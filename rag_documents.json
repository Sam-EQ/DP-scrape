    "content": "AEC Tech NYC 11/11 – 11/16/2025 AEC Tech NYC 2025 brought together designers, engineers, and technologists to look closely at how technology is actually being used in practice today. Rather than centering on tools in isolation, the conference focused on workflows, decision-making, and collaboration across firms. Perkins&Will participated in several parts of the conference, including the Tech Crawl, Symposium, and Hackathon. As part of the Tech Crawl, Perkins&Will hosted one of the open-studio visits at the New York office. The session was informal and discussion-driven, offering visitors a view into how digital tools and processes are developed and tested within live project conditions. The focus was less on finished solutions and more on how teams work through complexity, adapt standards, and balance experimentation with delivery. The Symposium formed the core discussion event of the conference, with Perkins&Will hosting one of the sessions in its New York studio. Talks and panels covered a range of topics, including computational design, data-driven workflows, environmental analysis, and the growing role of automation in design and engineering. Much of the conversation centered on how these technologies are changing the structure of practice—how decisions are made, how responsibilities shift, and how designers maintain authorship and accountability as systems become more complex. The conference concluded with a two-day Hackathon that emphasized making over presentation. Interdisciplinary teams formed quickly and worked intensively to prototype tools and workflows responding to real challenges in the AEC industry. Perkins&Will team members participated alongside peers from other firms, contributing design insight and technical experience while testing ideas through rapid iteration. Taken together, these moments reflected a shared interest in openness, practical experimentation, and learning through doing. Perkins&Will’s involvement across the conference reinforced the value of engaging directly with evolving technologies—not as finished products, but as part of an ongoing, collective practice.",

    "content": "Updated SharePoint Link Permission Guidance SharePoint Sharing: Default to People You Choose (External Sharing) When sharing files externally in SharePoint, the default mindset should be intentional access . In nearly all cases, “People you Choose” should be your go-to option for external sharing—ensuring the right external partners have the right level of access while keeping our documents secure and compliant. Sharing settings can be adjusted by clicking the gear icon in the Share screen. Taking a moment here helps prevent access issues, protects sensitive information, and keeps collaboration predictable—especially when working with consultants, clients, and vendors. Internal sharing guidance remains unchanged: For internal collaboration, continue to prioritize “People in Perkins&Will” to provide seamless access for colleagues while maintaining firmwide security standards. Note: Some Clients/Projects have “need to know” requirements in our contracts.  This means that use of the “ People in Perkins&Will” link cannot be used due to the lack of our ability to audit who has accessed the information. Please verify with your Project Manager and/or CEL if your project has this type of restriction. SharePoint Link Usage Policy (External Sharing) 1. Default: Controlled External Collaboration For documents or folders that require editing, commenting, or ongoing collaboration with external partners , always use “This link works for… People you Choose.” Access is granted only to named individuals by entering their email addresses. Permissions are clear, auditable, and aligned with our security standards. Recipients will be required to sign in with Microsoft to verify they are the intended receiver. This is the only approved method for granting edit or collaboration rights to external users. Using “People you Choose” ensures accountability, minimizes risk, and avoids accidental oversharing—particularly for active project work and contractual deliverables. Note: Once you have shared a folder with someone using “People you Choose” , you can send them links to individual files and subfolders by picking “People with Existing Access”. 2. Exception: View-Only External Dissemination In limited situations, external recipients may have trouble accessing files due to client IT policies, security incompatibilities, or contractual constraints . If this occurs, pause and confirm with the Project Manager before proceeding. Once confirmed, a view-only “This link works for… Anyone” link may be used for external dissemination only . “Anyone” links are view-only and cannot be used for collaboration. Links automatically expire after 30 days. For sensitive or confidential content, apply a password before sharing. This option should be treated as a fallback , not a default. Note: Some Clients/Projects have “need to know” requirements in our contracts.  This means that use of the ‘ Anyone ‘ link cannot be used due to the lack of our ability to audit who has accessed the information. Please verify with your Project Manager and/or CEL if your project has this type of restriction. Sample of the additional share settings accessed by clicking the gear icon Why This Matters By defaulting to “People you Choose” for external sharing and “People in Perkins&Will” for internal collaboration , we reduce confusion, strengthen security, and keep access aligned with project needs and contractual obligations. The “Anyone” link is a tool—not a shortcut —to be used thoughtfully when standard access isn’t possible. When in doubt, stop and check your sharing settings—or confirm with your Project Manager. A few extra seconds upfront can prevent access issues, rework, and unnecessary risk later on.",

    "content": "2026 Q1 Core eXchange Recap! Core eXchange: Back to Basics and Building Shared Understanding Last month’s Core eXchange presentation series focused on strengthening shared foundations across the firm. The sessions were intentionally designed as introductory and refresher content, creating space for teams to align around core tools, workflows, and ideas that support effective project delivery, digital practice, and sustainable design. Returning to Fundamentals A central theme of the series was expanding the “Back to Basics” approach from last October. Presentations revisited essential concepts such as early digital planning, right-sizing effort to project complexity, and establishing clear expectations at the start of work. These topics reinforced the importance of proactive decision-making and consistent setup as a way to reduce risk, improve efficiency, and support teams throughout the life of a project. Shared Tools and Common Platforms Another focus of the series was building familiarity and confidence with firmwide tools and platforms. Sessions emphasized how shared systems support people, projects, clients, and knowledge, and how small, regular interactions with these tools contribute to better visibility, coordination, and reporting. Rather than positioning these platforms as destinations, the series highlighted their role in supporting quick, everyday tasks that collectively strengthen firmwide insight and alignment. Knowledge, Learning, and Accessibility The series also reinforced the value of accessible knowledge and shared learning. Presentations showcased how guidance, research, and practical resources are organized to support teams in solving problems, exploring new approaches, and applying lessons learned across projects. By making expertise easier to find and apply, the series underscored how knowledge sharing supports consistency and continuous improvement. Sustainability and Emerging Practices Several sessions connected foundational workflows to broader environmental and design goals. Topics explored how materials, data, and decision-making intersect with sustainability, health, and long-term performance. These discussions positioned emerging practices not as isolated innovations, but as extensions of core design principles that can be integrated into everyday work. Looking Ahead Across all sessions, the consistent message was that strong digital and design practices are built on clarity, shared understanding, and intentional choices. By revisiting fundamentals and aligning around common approaches, Digital Practice and the Core eXchange lecture series continues to support teams in delivering high-quality, resilient, and forward-looking work. All session recordings and slides are available in the Exchange Library on the Digital Practice site . Thank you to all our Presenters! View the Recordings on The Digital Practice Exchange Library Back to Basics Series Five Back to Basics sessions formed the foundation of this quarter’s program, each highlighting the essential workflows that aid with project delivery: Back to Basics with Area Sync – Explained how to use Area Sync to track, validate, and reconcile program and design areas throughout a project lifecycle.

    "content": "Chicago Innovate 2025: Tools, Tech, and Two Days of Hacking Chicago Innovate returned this September with a full week of talks, panels, workshops, and a two-day hackathon focused on pushing digital innovation forward across the AEC industry. Running from September 22–28, the event brought together architects, engineers, technologists, and software developers to explore how emerging tools can meaningfully improve the way we design and deliver projects. I was fortunate enough to be invited to the Tools & Technology track as a presenter and panelist alongside Kevin Kosciulek (bKL) , Alexandra Pollack (CORE Studio) , Ann Schuessler (AssemblyBuilt) , and culminating in a keynote by James Coleman (SumPoint) . My talk focused on a simple idea: creating and rolling out tools isn’t about the tools themselves. It’s about understanding the people who rely on them. Empathy, timing, and good implementation matter far more than features. “Technology succeeds when it meets people where they are.” Inside the Hackathon Our Chicago studio was represented in the two-day hackathon by Jason Pieper , who had just come off a month-earlier hackathon in Boston. That experience shaped how he approached this one: clear pitches, the right mix of skills, and just enough prep to give a team a running start. In Boston, Jason’s group prototyped an early-stage embodied carbon calculator. It was a collaboration built across architects, engineers, and software developers. That early exposure informed how he framed his pitch in Chicago, where polish and clarity proved essential. “A good idea helps. A good 30-second pitch gets a team.” For the Chicago Innovate event, Jason’s team built a web application that combines Rhino Compute, Grasshopper, Karamba, and OpenAI . Designers could describe a structural goal in natural language, watch the tool iterate on solutions, and see results as charts and a color-coded 3D model. It was a proof of concept, but a compelling one: bridging expert workflows with intuitive, conversational interfaces. Across both hackathons, a consistent theme emerged: the industry isn’t short on tools. It’s short on tools with purpose that people want to use. The teams gravitated toward removing friction, simplifying complex analysis, and building bridges between specialists and everyday project workflows. Jason summed it up well: “The goal is always the same: better design. The barrier is usability.” These events also broke down the usual silos. Architects teamed with structural engineers, software developers, even competitors. The result: fast prototyping, unexpected insights, and momentum that continues after the weekend ends. Chicago Innovate reinforced what many of us already know: progress in AEC comes from mixing disciplines, testing ideas quickly, and keeping people—not technology—at the center of our digital decisions.",

    "content": "SpeckleCon 2025: Putting data to work with Speckle SpeckleCon 2025 made one thing clear: data interoperability and automation are no longer experimental concepts reserved for computational specialists — they are becoming everyday tools in architectural practice. Held at CodeNode in London, our London Digital Practice Colleagues, Adam Burnham, Osman Sahinbozkir, Xiaoheng Li attended the conference. SpeckleCon brought together architects, engineers, developers, and builders to explore how open-data workflows are transforming design and construction. For architects in particular, the event highlighted a shift toward more fluid collaboration, faster iteration, and an emerging culture of “design intelligence” — using clear, connected data to inform better decisions. Key Themes From Collaboration to Construction A recurring theme throughout the sessions was the ability to bridge conceptual design and real-world construction using unified, real-time data streams. Presenters showed how Speckle enables early-stage design models, simulations, and analysis to feed directly into engineering and fabrication workflows. Examples ranged from automated quality checks on construction models to generating performance insights (daylight, energy, carbon) during early massing studies. For architects, this means the gap between design intent and execution is narrowing. Instead of exporting, translating, and coordinating across disconnected tools, teams can work through a shared digital backbone — one that remains consistent from concept to construction. Design Intelligence Over Data Volume Several talks emphasised that data only becomes powerful when it’s understandable. Architects are often overwhelmed by data-rich environments: simulations, BIM models, material databases, cost information. SpeckleCon speakers pushed for clarity instead of complexity — highlighting workflows that present designers with clean dashboards, simplified analytic snapshots, and curated datasets. The message was simple: the goal isn’t more data; it’s better design decisions . Scaling Automation in Practice A highlight of the event was the introduction of Speckle Automate , a system for triggering automated tasks whenever a model changes. For architects, this could mean: instant daylight analysis every time a massing model updates automatic model audits before internal reviews automated geometry clean-up before sharing with engineers continuous carbon feedback during façade development These tools support a future where repetitive tasks disappear from a designer’s plate, freeing teams to focus on creativity and problem-solving. Why SpeckleCon Matters for Architecture For architects, SpeckleCon 2025 underscored three major directions for the industry: Interoperability is becoming a baseline expectation. No firm wants to be locked into single-software workflows anymore. Automation will redefine productivity. Architects will spend less time translating, exporting, validating, and cleaning models — and more time designing. Data-driven design is maturing. Instead of overwhelming dashboards, designers will get actionable insights embedded directly into their process. Architectural practice is shifting from drawing-centric workflows to data-centric ones — and Speckle is positioning itself at the heart of that transformation.",

    "content": "CDFAM was historically known for its focus on Computational Design For Added Manufacturing which had a strong focus on added manufacturing across all industries, architecture, manufacturing, product design, aviation and space to name a few. The organization seems to be rebranding itself and expanding its reach into Computational Design For: A dvanced M odeling A rchitectural M odeling A rchitected M aterials A I Driven M aterials A I Driven M odeling A I & M achine Learning A dditive M anufacturing A dvanced M anufacturing A _______ M ________ This recent symposium held this Fall in New York at Newlab in the Brooklyn Navy Yards had a wide range of speakers from different industries. This year’s keynote speakers Markus J. Buehler from MIT and Ian Pegler from NVIDIA each shared their perspectives on AI and product development respectively. Buehler makes the case that LLM’s will give us “brilliant parrots”, but they will not give us discovery. Behler defines discovery as the art of “asking the right question to express ideas. LLM’s cannot express ideas”. AI models cannot be trained on data and expect it to discover something outside of that data. Discovery requires outside perspectives. AI can help convert complexities into principles and create graphs which humans can use to help discover relationships. Pegler claims that a lot of innovation happens at one’s desk à people at work, by themselves in momentary isolation, able to think and question, something that AI cannot do. A selection of the presentations can be found on this youtube playlist . AI and the Battle for the Soul of Design Chris McComb, Carnegie Mellon University Chris McComb from Carnegie Mellon University thinks that AI and automation will help us reallocate time for better task. We neglect the value of subtractive changes when aiming to make improvements, often we look at adding tasks or adding features, but it’s critical that we consider subtractive changes. When it comes to the integration of AI into our work, humans have the unfair advantage of empathy. Design as Dialog: Form Jamming with AI Agents Matthew Goldsberry & Juling Zhuang, HDR HDR recently presented their explorations using the Rhino Model Context Protocol (MCP) in combination with external databases containing architectural domain knowledge. While Rhino is an excellent modeling tool and AI can help automate tasks, neither inherently understands the context of building assemblies. By injecting metadata into the MCP and connecting it to these specialized databases, the system becomes far more context aware. Designers can then interact with their models using architectural terms such as curtain wall or façade and the AI model can interpret what the discrete components are required in the model and how they behave. The result is more intuitive and efficient working collaboration. Running Revolution: Computational Design Behind Puma Fast-R NITRO Elite 3 – Moon Rabbit Lab x Puma Jesus Marini, Moon Rabbit Lab Moon Rabbit Lab is a computational design studio based in Milan Italy that focuses on pushing the boundaries of performance products through innovative design and engineering. Marini’s presentation focused on the six stages of a project: Data Collection Computational Data Processing Product Insights Product Development Prototype & Physical Validation Signoff Marini demonstrated how the Puma Fast-R NITRO Elite 3 shoe design followed these six stages to achieve a better performing product for athletes to achieve greater success. The result was a product where athletes where able to break their own personal records. Digital Twinning a Living Lab David Gerber, University of Southern California Dr. David Gerber presented the Living Lab Project which focuses on latest work done by USC, converting Ginsburg Hall building into a building with an api. The research project is meant to “provide practical learning experiences through real-time monitoring and analysis”. By deploying a wide range of IoT sensors, the university is able to track energy usage, water consumption, building health, and occupant well-being and more. The comprehensive dataset allows researchers to understand how a building changes and evolves over different time periods, both short and long. The dataset is made publicly available for collaborative research. A Parametric Structural Genome: Using Computational Design To Manage Compound Tolerances Of Multiple Materials To Create The World‘s Largest Double Curved Outdoor LED Screen Gustav Fagerström, Walter P Moore & Steve Reichwein, Severud Associates The duo of presenters took a deep dive into the structure and façade for the Las Vegas Sphere project. The project consists of a 360-degree sphere shaped LED façade that acts as an immersive screen. The exterior dome has a three-tiered structural system, with each tier increasing in its level of accuracy to maintain the high precision tolerances required for the screen to  function as planned. Casting the primary nodes helped reduce the overall weight of the structure while increasing the level of accuracy and reducing overall cost. When it came time to install the final structural piece of the sphere, the engineers and builders were concerned about the thermal expansion of the structure due to the extreme temperature swings associated with Las Vegas. The local building officials were on hand and there was talk about calling  the local fire department in case the team needed to replicate the same procedures required for installing the keystone for the St Louis Arch . Fortunately, the final piece was installed early in the day before the temperatures started to climb.",

    "content": "Smarter Estates, Smarter Care — Reflections from Healthcare Estates 2025 This year’s Healthcare Estates Conference in Manchester brought together the people who design, manage and operate the NHS estate at what feels like a critical moment. With ageing infrastructure, growing clinical demand, workforce pressures and a maintenance backlog approaching £16bn , the focus has understandably shifted from what could we do? to what must we address first? It created exactly the right context for the two sessions Perkins&Will delivered in the Design & Construction Theatre: “Smarter Estates, Smarter Care” , which I presented alongside Gonzalo Vargas, and “Master Planning for the Future” , presented by Rachelle McDade (Currie & Brown) and our colleague Rafael Marks. A huge thank you goes to Thomas Kearns and Aprameya Pandit , whose preparation, analysis and technical support underpinned both presentations and helped ensure the content was grounded, accurate and genuinely useful for Trusts On the Exhibition Floor One of the most interesting parts of the event was the exhibition floor, which this year felt even more connected to the challenges and ambitions of the NHS estate. The standout feature was the New Hospital Programme’s “Hospital 2.0” single-bedroom prototype — a full-scale inpatient room designed to show what future repeatable hospital components could look like. The mock-up demonstrated everything from standardised room layouts and modern materials to integrated medical equipment and clearer staff sightlines. Alongside this, there was a noticeable increase in digital vendors showing real-time location systems, asset-tagging solutions, IoT-driven monitoring and CAFM/CMMS platforms. Even without physical robots on the floor, AI, automation and robotics were highly visible in the keynote programme. NHS England’s Day 2 keynote explicitly referenced them as emerging technologies set to influence the way healthcare infrastructure is designed, delivered and maintained — signalling a decisive shift in mindset across the sector. Our Presentations Master Planning for the Future — Rachelle McDade & Rafael Marks Against that backdrop, Rachelle and Rafael’s session focused on how Trusts can take a more strategic, long-range approach to their estates — moving beyond the piecemeal, reactive decision-making that has shaped the NHS estate for decades. Using their work with the Royal Free Hospital as a case study, they outlined a clinically led, digitally enabled strategic toolkit that helps organisations understand their estate in the context of clinical priorities, future service models, sustainability pressures, and operational risk . They walked through a structured process that runs from vision-setting and clinical engagement , through scenario testing and cost modelling , to Board-ready reporting . The result is a planning framework that gives Trusts genuine clarity and confidence when evaluating options. A standout element was their use of interoperable digital tools — including Portfolio Explorer, Area Sync, Campus Planner and Dorian — which together enable real-time scenario modelling and provide decision-makers with a clear view of value, constraints and opportunity . Their message was simple and convincing: the NHS needs strategic, clinically anchored planning frameworks that help Trusts make smarter decisions, maximise limited resources, and build estates that can stand up to future pressures. Based on the strength of this work — and the recent presentation to Worcester NHS Trust — we expect to undertake a small feasibility study across multiple sites from January to March 2026 , followed by a full Estates Strategy for the Trust. Both pieces will adopt the same Campus Planner methodology applied at the Royal Free. In parallel, we’ve also been approached by a Trust in Wales to deliver a similar programme. These opportunities are being led by Currie & Brown Smarter Estates, Smarter Care — Myself & Gonzalo Vargas Our own session, “Smarter Estates, Smarter Care” , picked up the thread from a different angle: the operational layer beneath estates planning. We focused on a challenge almost every Trust faces — the basic data foundations simply aren’t strong enough to support the decisions estates teams need to make every day . Across programmes, SOA requirements, room layouts and assets, information is often held in different places, authored by different people and updated at different times. We showed how that fragmentation forces estates teams to rebuild data repeatedly, rather than trust it. A live demo from our platform illustrated how programme, spatial information and assets can be synchronised into one coherent view, giving teams real-time clarity and removing hours of manual reconciliation. From there we explored asset visibility, which remains one of the biggest operational inefficiencies across the NHS estate. Many Trusts still rely on partial inventories, outdated spreadsheets or repeated resurveying simply to understand what they have and where it is. By connecting asset data to spaces, tagging and RFID systems, we demonstrated how Trusts can eliminate unnecessary repeat work, improve response times and reduce costs associated with poor information quality. That idea tied neatly into our discussion of ERIC — a dataset with huge strategic value that is rarely used to its full potential. We showed how linking ERIC to spatial and asset data creates a live operational picture rather than an annual reporting exercise, helping estates teams identify risk, model investment and respond to ongoing pressures. We finished by focusing on what we believe is the missing link in many NHS projects: a lifecycle-wide digital backbone . Planning, design, construction, handover and operations are still too often disconnected, with every phase producing its own version of the truth. We showed how a common digital language — built around structured, reusable, validated information — allows Trusts to capture data once and reuse it everywhere, unlocking the operational benefits people expect from digital twins and smarter estates without the costs or complexity that often get in the way. Key Takeaways from other Sessions Taken together with the wider conference content, a few themes stood out strongly. First, AI, automation and robotics are now firmly part of the national estates conversation — not as futuristic concepts but as tools that will influence how assets are monitored, maintained and managed. Second, digital innovation is becoming a core expectation rather than a side topic. And finally, workforce and financial pressures are accelerating the need for better information: Trusts simply can’t afford inefficiencies caused by fragmented data or disconnected systems. Across the exhibition, the keynotes and the sessions we contributed, the message was consistent: the NHS doesn’t just need new hospitals — it needs smarter, data-enabled ones. And the smartest estates aren’t the ones with the most technology; they are the ones built on structured, reliable, connected information. Better data = better decisions = better estates = better care",

    "content": "ACADIA 2025 came to Miami this year and included 3 days of workshops, research paper presentations, panel discussions at the University of Miami and Florida International University. Perkins Will was a Silver Sponsor. We’re also proud to mention that one of our Senior Project Designers in the Miami Studio, Juan Yactayo , was a chair through his affiliation with the University of Miami. Computing for Resilience ACADIA 2025 centers on COMPUTING for RESILIENCE, a theme inspired by Miami’s urgent physical, economic, and climate challenges. As a city facing rising seas, political pressures, and historical erasure, Miami has become both a hotspot for risk and a proving ground for innovation. The conference explores how computational design and advanced fabrication can help architects and technologists develop adaptable, future-ready solutions. By leveraging digital tools to address climate impacts and shifting social conditions, ACADIA 2025 aims to expand community knowledge and position Miami as a model for resilient urban transformation. Sessions included in-person workshops at both the University of Miami and Florida International University, and online workshops. Florida International University hosted paper sessions, project sessions, panel sessions, and award sessions. Workshops In-person workshops explored cutting-edge fabrication techniques from bio-based and concrete 3D printing to robotic design and marine restoration highlighting innovative, sustainable, and adaptive approaches to material and structural creation. Online workshops covered topics ranging from neuroscience and climate intelligence to AI-driven design, timber joinery, and adaptive assembly. Behind the scenes at the ACADIA 2025 workshops hosted at the University of Miami School of Architecture Paper Sessions Technical papers accepted by ACADIA were presented in 10 sessions during the course of over three days. Cloud Garden: Neural Rendering and Point Cloud Modeling of Landscapes Day One Paper Sessions highlighted 3D printing and robotic fabrication, AI-driven landscape and coastal resilience strategies, and innovative material and biofabrication techniques. Day Two Paper Sessions highlighted robotic and textile-based fabrication, innovative timber construction and material reuse, and human-AI collaborative design and construction workflows. Day Three Paper Sessions highlighted the integration of AI and computational methods in architecture, spanning sustainable design, resilient housing, human-centered tools, and the cultural and social impact of emerging technologies. In thr first session of Day Three, PW Senior Researcher Marcelo Bernal presented “ Predicting Embodied Carbon Using Early Design Parameters and Machine Learning” . Marcelo worked on this paper with other PW notable researchers Jesce Walz , Victor Okhoya , Spyros Ampanavos . From Marcelo, “Unlike LCA which occurs at the end of the design process, early predictions can provide feedback on demand during conceptual design helping designers to indentify trends and make decision when matter they most.” Click here for more: Predicting Embodied Carbon Field Notes The Field Notes category is designed as an alternative publishing venue within ACADIA that welcomes experimental, provocative, and not-fully-polished ideas . Instead of traditional peer-reviewed technical papers, it creates space for shorter, more reflective, critical, and exploratory works that respond to the uncertainties, constraints, and shifting conditions of contemporary research and design practice. The work presented showcased innovative architectural research combining AR-enhanced pedagogy, playful and bio-inspired prototyping, and sustainable fabrication using natural, recycled, and growth-based materials. Some of the topics included Physics simulation for enhanced AR to teach students how to work with gravity instead of against it. Architectural reinterpretations of oyster shells to create modular interlocking systems. Training robotic arms to play with soap bubbles Utilizing Sargassum as an additive to concrete to enhance thermal performance. Projects Another series of published work that was presented was Projects which was divided into 3 sessions called Material Resilience, Crafting Resilience, and Territorial Resilience . They collectively explore how designers rethink assembly, craft, and inhabitation across scales—from wearable bio-materials to building systems and city-scale carbon futures—using computation, digital precision, and material intelligence to challenge conventional practices and model new, enduring approaches for an uncertain future. Material Resilience explores how innovative bio-based, computational, and performance-driven materials, from wearable bioplastics and living composites to porous glass facades and 3D-printed ceramic enclosures, redefine assembly across scales, demonstrating new possibilities for sustainable, adaptive building systems. Crafting Resilience investigated climate-responsive design, adaptive and reversible construction, and bio-driven architectural systems from cooling furniture, kinetic structures, and AR-guided timber assembly to biodiversity-supporting facades, low-carbon vaults, kerf-bent frames, and architectures that grow or reconfigure over time. Territorial Resilience explored digital and robotic approaches to adaptive, resource-conscious architecture, including digital twins for live experimentation, AI-supported urban reuse strategies, frameworks for commercial-to-residential conversion, robotics that expand architectural practice, and feedback-driven methods for architectural recycling. DUAL Pavilion DUAL 3D Printed Pavillion 3D printed from recycled car tires, DUAL is the result of a collaboration between Pininfarina , Alpha Additive , Florida International University, and the University of Miami. This pavilion was on display at FIU’s Paul Cejas Architecture Building Summary ACADIA 2025 ultimately showcased how designers, researchers, and educators are redefining resilience through computation, demonstrating that innovative materials, adaptive fabrication, and forward-looking technologies can help shape more responsive, equitable, and climate-ready futures for Miami and beyond.",

    "content": "Last month, our very own Leigh Stringer , Global Director of Advisory Services, and Raja R. Kadiyala , Sidara’s Global Head of Digital Solutions, hosted The Digitally Enabled Built Environment event at 150 Holborn — a half-day that somehow managed to feel like both a research symposium and a tech show-and-tell. In a few short hours, we moved from robots supporting people living with frailty , to soft-robotic environments that sense emotion , to AI monitoring biodiversity in cities , through to technology disruption in AEC , the digital twin of 150 Holborn , and finally building analytics and portfolio-scale decarbonisation . It was fast, fascinating, and occasionally a bit mind-bending — but every talk circled back to the same question: How do we use data and automation to make environments that care, respond, and learn? Jump to a session: 🤖 Robots for Care and Frailty 🏗️ Soft Robotic Architecture 🌿 Sensing Garden: AI for Biodiversity ⚙️ Technology Disruption in AEC 🏢 150 Holborn: The Living Smart Building 🧠 Automated Building Analytics 🌎 Decarbonisation at Scale Robots for Care and Frailty — UCL Bartlett & Centre for Behaviour Change Dr Evangelia Chrysikou and Dr Vivi Antonopoulou reminded us that innovation in care is as much about empathy as engineering. Their UCL–Cardiff collaboration studied how people living with frailty interact with commercial robots like Mylo and Pepper in real homes — not pristine lab conditions. They found that people liked the friendly presence and simple voice control — in fact, robots were seen as “Star Trek-like” companions. But poor connectivity, narrow corridors, and an understandable reluctance to rely on tech too much all created barriers. A key image showed The Robot House, mapping where these robots could actually move — mostly living rooms and corridors, rarely kitchens or bathrooms. The message was clear: our homes aren’t designed for robots, and robots aren’t yet designed for our homes. The takeaway for us as designers? We need to think about how people, places, and technology work together — not in isolation. Soft Robotic Architecture (UCL PEARL) If the first session was about robots living with people, this one was about spaces that behave like robots. Dr Valentina Soana and Professor Nick Tyler showcased ELAmorph , a shape-changing environment that uses sensors to respond to human movement, stress, and emotion. Participants literally watched the space breathe with them — and the physiological data backed it up. The team combined biometric sensing and motion analysis to track brain activity, heart rate, posture, and temperature. It sounds futuristic, but the response was very human — participants described the experience as calming, fun, and emotionally uplifting. All of this took place at PEARL (Person–Environment–Activity Research Laboratory) in Dagenham — a full-scale research facility designed by Perkins & Will London . It’s purpose-built for exactly this kind of experimentation: exploring how light, sound, and movement affect perception. The bigger idea? Architecture as a living interface — spaces that don’t just measure performance, but respond to emotion. It’s a glimpse of where our own digital-twin and sensor-driven projects might evolve — buildings that genuinely listen, learn, and adapt Sensing Garden: AI for Biodiversity (MIT / Sidara) The Sensing Garden , from MIT’s Senseable City Lab in partnership with Sidara, took us outdoors — into cities and ecosystems. It asks how technology can help us see and measure biodiversity in real time. With global COP biodiversity goals and the UK’s 10 % net-gain requirement, this research feels especially timely. https://digitalpractice.perkinswill.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Video-Project-18.mp4 Treepedia visualises the “green view” from street level, helping cities measure and compare visible canopy cover The project layers several sensing methods: • Infrared and satellite imagery to track vegetation and temperature patterns. • LiDAR and vegetation indices to measure canopy density, health, and moisture. • Acoustic and visual AI models to identify insects and birds by sound or movement, plus e-DNA sampling to confirm which species are actually present. Together, these datasets create a live ecological “twin” — showing how life interacts with streets, buildings, and microclimates. MIT’s earlier tools — Treepedia (“green view”), Diversitree (biodiversity tracking), and Green Bias (access inequality) — now combine into a single platform for biodiversity intelligence . It’s a shift from symbolic greening to evidence-based ecology — quantifying how design decisions really affect urban ecosystems In short: the next generation of smart-city tools won’t just count people or carbon — they’ll measure life itself. Technology Disruption in AEC (Sidara) Dr Raja Kadiyala’s session reframed “disruption” as something to harness, not fear. He began with a story from science: at Cyclotron Road in Berkeley, a group of physicists, chemists, and engineers built one of the first particle accelerators nearly a century ago — sparking innovations from X-ray imaging to CRISPR The point wasn’t nostalgia — it was perspective. True disruption happens when disciplines collide Raja then unveiled Sidara’s Periodic Table of Disruptors — a taxonomy of over 100 emerging technologies grouped into: Data Ecosystems Extreme Automation Human Augmentation Human–Machine Interactions The Smart Planet Each “element” links back to research and industry examples — from IoT and 6G to building cybersecurity and edge computing. Rather than chasing every trend, he proposed a simple framework: Hold → Assess → Pilot → Adopt. That structure turns innovation into a living roadmap , helping teams invest deliberately rather than reactively. For us, the message hit home: digital is horizontal. It crosses disciplines, workflows, and mindsets — and transformation depends as much on culture as on code. 150 Holborn: The Living Smart Building — Sidara / PARA The day’s theory met reality with 150 Holborn — Sidara’s new HQ and our own London studio — positioned as a Living Lab for the group. The PARA team described the journey from blue-sky concept in 2016 to a fully connected, data-driven workplace in 2025. A single converged network now links lighting, access, occupancy, energy, and ESG reporting. Over 650 sensors collect data every five minutes across 18 500 m² , feeding a live digital twin that visualises performance, comfort, and sustainability. For the London studio , this was also the first outing for our Digital Advisory service — where we managed design and construction data to ensure handover through a structured platform rather than a folder of PDFs. It proved how information can be captured once, structured properly, and reused throughout the building’s lifecycle — and that process has since become a model for other clients. The result is a workspace that continuously learns and adjusts — reducing energy, improving wellbeing, and supporting FM decisions with evidence rather than instinct. PARA called it the building’s digital nervous system , which feels about right. And while claims of being “one of the smartest buildings” are hard to measure, the Living Lab idea is real. It’s where our digital-twin thinking moved from theory to practice , proving that data-centric delivery can create lasting value for both owners and occupants. 150 Holborn is now where clients come to see the art of the possible — where design, data, and operations truly meet. Automated Building Analytics (CopperTree Analytics) If 150 Holborn shows what’s possible when you design smart from day one, CopperTree Analytics (part of Sidara) shows how to make existing buildings smarter. COO Derek Mullassery presented a platform that unifies disconnected systems — BMS, meters, CAFM, CMMS — through an Independent Data Layer . Once everything’s speaking the same language, Fault Detection and Diagnostics (FDD) finds inefficiencies, and Automated System Optimisation (ASO) fine-tunes performance in real time. Results: • £623 000 gas savings at a UK healthcare facility in five years • 15–30 % energy reductions across US university campuses • Continuous commissioning replacing reactive maintenance With ageing FM workforces and growing ESG pressures, this kind of automation frees teams to focus on strategy, not spreadsheets. It delivers digital-twin benefits after handover — bridging the gap between design ambition and operational reality. For portfolio clients, CopperTree effectively becomes a digital retrofit for performance — a scalable way to measure, benchmark, and improve every building, not just the newest ones. Decarbonisation at Scale (Carbon Signal) Where CopperTree optimises one building at a time, Carbon Signal scales that intelligence across entire portfolios. Carbon Signal applies physics-based modelling and AI to help organisations decarbonise building portfolios at scale. Dr Shreshth Nagpal introduced a method that blends physics-based energy modelling with AI autocalibration , closing what he calls the building-energy intelligence gap. Traditional consultancy models are accurate but slow; AI-only tools are fast but often fuzzy. Carbon Signal merges the two — rapid, rigorous, and repeatable. Feed it a handful of metrics — size, climate zone, energy use — and it infers insulation, air-tightness, and lighting efficiency, generating reliable simulations across thousands of buildings. Already used by MIT, Yale, and Amazon , the platform has modelled over 10 000 buildings covering 1.5 billion ft² , cutting analysis time from months to minutes and enabling science-based retrofit strategies. If 150 Holborn shows how a building can be born smart , and CopperTree shows how an existing one can learn , then Carbon Signal shows how whole portfolios can act together — intelligently and at speed — to achieve net zero. Final Thought Across every session, one theme stood out: digital transformation is still about people. From robotics to biodiversity, from smart workplaces to portfolio analytics — the common thread was empathy and intent. The challenge for us isn’t just to build smarter tools; it’s to keep asking smarter questions — about who benefits, how systems interact, and how we design for change that actually lasts.",

    "content": "AEC Tech Boston 9/19 – 9/21/2025 In September, AECTech+ Boston represented the launch of a new regional chapter of the AEC Tech community. Co-hosted by Perkins&Will and Thornton Tomasetti, the inaugural event brought the energy and ethos of the long-running New York conference into a new city with a strong academic and innovation ecosystem. From the start, the focus remained true to what makes AEC Tech distinct: practitioner-driven content that shares real workflows, real challenges, and real breakthroughs from design technology professionals. This first edition introduced Boston’s growing network of computational designers, sustainability leaders, and digital practice innovators to the AEC Tech format: a multi-day program including workshops, a Tech Tour, a symposium, and a hackathon. Attendees represented a mix of leading firms and ambitious students from local institutions, affirming Boston as a natural home for this expansion of the conference series. The speaker lineup highlighted both global thought leaders and emerging voices, demonstrating an emphasis on the future of design computation. Across sessions, presenters showcased automation strategies, data-driven design, interdisciplinary research, and entrepreneurial tools accelerating change in the built environment. Perkins&Will played a central role throughout the event, contributing organizers, speakers, and participants for the workshops and hackathon. The studio also partnered on the Tech Tour, creating opportunities for candid discussion about integrating advanced technology in live project delivery. AECTech+ Boston’s success in its first year signals a growing regional hub for AEC innovation. The energy from this inaugural gathering set a strong foundation for continued collaboration and reinforces the value of practitioners shaping the next generation of design technology together. Hackathon Participation A hackathon brings architects, engineers, and construction professionals together to rapidly experiment, prototype, and solve real challenges in the built-environment. Teams form around shared ideas and apply computational tools, automation, and creative problem-solving to push the boundaries of how we design, deliver, and operate buildings. The AECTech+ Boston hackathon ran as a 26-hour sprint from Saturday to Sunday morning. Nearly 40 participants hit the ground running, pitching ideas in a lightning round that quickly sparked collaboration. By early morning, seven teams emerged, with Perkins&Will contributing talent to more than half of them. The atmosphere was energetic, focused, and full of possibility.

    "content": "Revit Template Update Last week, we rolled out our Revit US Template update. It was truly collaborative effort between a Technical Directors Community and a group of Revit experts from Digital Practice. Most notable improvements were made to Code Compliance Workflow . Code Compliance is a fundamental aspect of every project. This workflow improves consistency, traceability, and clarity in how occupancy and egress requirements are applied and communicated. It helps teams go beyond just “checking a box” by integrating code interpretation into the design process itself. By visually tying design intent to compliance, it reduces errors, increases confidence during permit reviews, and supports safer, more efficient buildings. It ensures code-related information is clearly represented in the model and coordinated across documentation. While not automated, the workflow helps teams illustrate and validate compliance with local code requirements—supporting both internal reviews and conversations with AHJs. As your studios start using this new template, you may want to review the process. It is thoroughly documented in this Palette card Code Compliance: Occupancy & Egress In addition to revamping Code compliance workflow, there were some minor changes, including deletion of unused parameters, updates to Finish workflow, and general cleanup. All studio templates based on this version of US template will have a version number above 10 Avail Channel for Revit 2025 To improve findability and relevancy of Revit content, we released new channel for 2025 Imperial content. Items in this channel are already upgraded to 2025, so they can be used faster. We also discarded never used and outdated content. However if you need something for the projects in old Revit versions, the old channel is still there. To find appropriate channel, use channel groups.

    "content": "On 16–17 September, a few of us from SHL attended BIM World Copenhagen. The event was full of inspiring talks and showcases that touched on digital innovation, AI, sustainability, and new regulatory frameworks shaping our industry. Here are some highlights that caught our attention: Exploring Solibri CheckPoint in BIM Workflows – Max Thorup Due (DK), NTI For years, Solibri has been a reliable desktop BIM checker. Now, it’s stepping into the cloud with Solibri CheckPoint — a browser-based, cloud-enabled model-checking tool. It supports native Revit and IFC files, allowing clash detection, data validation, and free-space checks directly in the browser, without heavy installs. It integrates with Autodesk Construction Cloud (ACC) and Procore, streamlining issue tracking and model syncing across platforms. Max showed how CheckPoint can be embedded into BIM workflows: federating models, applying rulesets, checking designs early, and managing issues collaboratively. For us in Copenhagen, this felt like a turning point: Solibri is finally catching up with the cloud-based, collaborative direction the industry has already taken. It hasn’t been released yet — but it looks promising. Data Workflow in the Danish Context (Data in Action – From Requirement to Impact) This session followed a state client project to show how data flows across all stages of the danish project cycle: ICT Manager/Client: collects requirements and documents them in an ICT manual for all disciplines. Consultants: set and update design parameters during development. Cost & Carbon Specialists: receive the data, which must be formatted to allow accurate analysis. Contractor: uses the data for validation, quantity take-off, and delivery. Client (handover): performs final checks and feeds data into facility management systems. The session underscored the risks of poor data practice, but also the benefits when structured processes are consistently followed by all disciplines in ideal project in ideal world. The Dirty Truth: How Much Do You Really Know About Carbon in Construction? – Matthew Jackson, ZERO Construct Matthew Jackson made a strong case for carbon literacy. Construction accounts for ~12% of global CO₂ (≈4.5B tons/year), and even a small share of decision-makers in our 275M-person industry have ~35× the carbon impact of the average person. Every decision — from material specifications to site supplies — matters. He introduced ZERO Construct, a 3,000-strong not-for-profit community creating a “Wikipedia for carbon” with open knowledge, workshops, playful tools like Carbon Top Trumps, and the upcoming ZeroCon event. Importantly, he engaged the audience with a live quiz (complete with prizes! Which I won) that made the session fun, interactive, and memorable. We wish more presentations used this format: clear numbers, practical steps, and participation. Watch Matthew’s talk here (recorded at another event): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBiPDnv4gBI Here is my dropping my reward on stage: AI and Opportunities for Women in Construction – Elia González Salas, CEO of KOSMOS & representant of Women in BIM Elia highlighted the urgent challenges in construction: women still make up only 9–10% of the workforce, while labour shortages are rising fast (the US alone will need 439,000 new workers by 2025). At the same time, AI is opening doors to new roles such as BIM Strategist, Data Translator, AI Product Manager, and Data Quality Lead — positions that thrive on curiosity, communication, and leadership, where women are especially well-placed to excel. She showed how KOSMOS is already applying AI (or not really AI) in procurement, document management, data modelling, and risk analysis. But she also stressed that inconsistent data and labelling remain barriers to accuracy — highlighting the need for standards and collaboration. Her closing message: construction is not just being digitized, it’s being rebuilt. If you’re in construction, explore technology. If you’re in tech, learn construction. And if you’re a woman questioning your place in this transformation — you absolutely belong. Learn more about Women in BIM organization: https://womeninbim.org/ I’ve personally been part of their mentoring scheme and found it a great experience in knowledge sharing. Sorry, We Had to Create a New Open BIM Format – Antonio Gonzalez Viegas, That Open Company Antonio, an architect turned software developer, compared construction software to the video game industry. While games can be built by small teams using engines, construction software still relies on outdated, proprietary systems that stifle innovation. His question was bold: what if we built a “game engine” for construction? This idea became Fragments, a new open-source BIM format that overcomes IFC’s limitations. Unlike IFC STEP, which is heavy, inconsistent, and slow, Fragments is lightweight and fast: it allows gigabyte-sized models to load in seconds, scale from city view to a single bolt, and run smoothly in a browser. It also supports property data, compression, and interoperability with glTF and 3D Tiles. Long-term, it aims not just for viewing, but also editing and authoring — and it’s all free and open source. The takeaway: construction deserves tools as modern, accessible, and flexible as other industries enjoy. With projects like Fragments sound and look promising. Watch the talk here(recorded at different event): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUiG6Jz-X-w Explore Fragments documentation: https://docs.thatopen.com/Tutorials/Fragments/ Use of AI at Henning Larsen – Jakob Strømann-Andersen, Innovation & Sustainability Director Jakob shared how Henning Larsen uses AI to support both creativity and efficiency. In competitions, their creative teams use AI to produce visuals and test ideas quickly — without losing creative control. For time-consuming tasks, like processing 50+ client documents, they used NotebookLM to answer questions and point directly to relevant files. This dialogue-based approach even worked across different languages, making collaboration easier for international teams. Jakob emphasized that AI doesn’t replace creativity — it frees it. By taking on repetitive work, AI lets designers focus on design, while also strengthening decision-making. He described how AI can even be used in real time during client meetings to test ideas and visualize solutions on the spot. This presentation was intresting to watch as in SHL we worked on few of the same competitions. Data is King: Realizing Circular Dreams – software showcase, Johana Rodriguez (JLL Design Lab), Brian Chiou (Reseat), Ren DeCherney (Cradle to Cradle Institute) This panel tackled a key challenge: sustainability data is everywhere, but often inaccurate or unusable. To make real impact, it needs to be accurate, structured, and actionable. Brian Chiou presented Reseat, a platform creating digital product passports for furniture. Every item gets a “Reseat ID” to track its lifecycle: condition, location, and history. When no longer needed, the system supports resale, donation, or refurbishment instead of disposal, backed by a marketplace and dealer/manufacturer integrations. By making data shareable and trustworthy, Reseat helps quantify carbon savings and reduce waste — a scalable way to bring circular economy principles into workplace design and operations. Learn more about Reseat here: https://www.reseat.com/ New EU Regulation: Digital Product Passports for Construction Products – Lars Christian Fredenlund, Co-founder, Cobuilder As part of Europe’s green and digital transition, the revised Construction Products Regulation (CPR) will require Digital Product Passports (DPPs) for all construction products in the EU/EEA market. Product data will now include Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs), structured via a European Data Dictionary, making it machine-readable and interoperable. Lars explained how these passports will link directly into BIM, EDI-order systems, and digital twins — embedding product data across design, construction, operations, compliance, and sustainability reporting. For us in Copenhagen and across the EU, this feels like a big step forward: moving from static PDFs to standardized, connected, and actionable product data. This will reshape procurement, compliance, and carbon reporting in the built environment.",

View the Recordings on The Digital Practice Exchange Library This quarter’s Digital Practice Core eXchange brought together twenty colleagues from across the firm to share updates, workflows, and experiments shaping our project delivery. Over the course of twelve sessions, we covered a wide range of topics from accessibility standards and sustainable materials to hands-on tools for project planning and visualization. Many sessions focused on practical improvements to daily work, including updates to PMTK , Portfolio Explorer , and AVAIL , along with documentation workflows for Finishes and Casework . Others provided a deeper dive into specialized areas like Barrier-free Design , biological materials , and Building Integrated Agriculture . Across the board, the level of engagement and willingness to share real-world use cases stood out. These sessions continue to create space for experimentation and cross-studio learning, helping us improve both how we work and what we deliver. Thank you to the 1,271 participants who showed up! All the sessions are saved to the Digital Practice Exchange Library: Click Here Theme Sessions: AI in Practice Three sessions from this Core eXchange focused specifically on how teams across Perkins&Will are using AI tools in real project work. If you’re still figuring out where AI fits into your day-to-day, these are a great place to start. In “Vibe Coding,” Harish Palani and Michael Honyak shared how they’re using large language models to automate repetitive, high-effort tasks—like scripting in AutoCAD or processing data in Excel. They walked through how to frame a problem clearly for an LLM, how to vet the output, and when it actually makes sense to use AI in production work. Meanwhile, “Elevating AI” with Brian Parish and Sergio Riccardi focused on firm-wide guidance, including what tools are approved, how to use them safely, and examples of in-house tools like Muse and RFP Navigator. “Applied AI Visualization,” led by Harish Palani, Anthony Samaha, and Michael Honyak offered a look at design visualization using platforms like Adobe Firefly—helping teams bridge the gap between sketches and early concept visuals, all while staying mindful of licensing and client privacy. If you’re wondering how AI fits into architecture and design beyond just headlines, these three sessions are a solid starting point. They’re focused, practical, and directly tied to the work many of us are already doing.

    "content": "At the AIA National Convention, over 13,000 architects gathered to discuss the future of design, technology, and sustainability. Among the numerous sessions, a daylong symposium organized by the Technology in Architectural Practice (TAP) and the Committee on the Environment (COTE) focused on how digital tools are shaping environmental outcomes. The event brought together architects, engineers, and technologists for in-depth discussions on design performance, regulatory changes, and emerging workflows. As a past chair of the TAP knowledge community, I was proud to see this collaborative effort come to fruition. The symposium began with a keynote address by Corey Squire, who explored the roles of humans and computers in sustainable design. He highlighted the importance of aligning technology with the values outlined in the AIA Framework for Design Excellence. Following the keynote, a panel on regulatory compliance and certification strategies featured Alejandra Menchaca, Jessica Zofchak, Kjell Anderson, and Z Smith. While the session primarily focused on green building systems, such as LEED and WELL, much of the discussion centered on professional agency and the influence of design teams on policy and performance. Later, Jack Rusk participated in two sessions, sharing insights from his work at CScale, a platform with which we’ve partnered to explore early-phase carbon modeling. His contributions emphasized how integrated and accessible tools are enabling design teams to incorporate emissions analysis into their decision-making processes rather than treating it as an afterthought. Throughout the day, additional panels covered topics such as carbon accounting, life cycle assessment, and data-informed workflows. An afternoon session addressed strategies for small and medium firms in adopting performance tools, with speakers sharing their experiences in navigating resource constraints while pursuing environmental objectives. The day concluded with a series of brief presentations on innovative approaches to climate-responsive design, including AI-driven analysis, dynamic visualization, and evolving project delivery models. A consistent theme throughout the symposium was that digital tools, including emerging AI technologies, are merely tools. It is the responsibility of designers to master these tools to create healthier, more resilient solutions for our clients and the communities we serve.",

    "content": "NXT BLD/DEV June 11/12 2025 Earlier this month, a team from SHL travelled to London to meet up with colleagues from Perkins&Will London studio for NXT BLD and NXT DEV, two conferences at the cutting edge of architecture, design technology, and the future of digital tools in AEC. From thought-provoking keynotes and emerging software demos to shared reflections on how we work, where our tools fall short, and how the next generation of software might finally catch up to the way we want to design. The energy was high and the pace of change even higher. Here are some of our key takeaways from the week: Ellen Berglund UX Design Lead Digital Practice “Everyone’s trying to build the next-gen BIM platform, and many are led by ex-Autodesk people who know what’s missing. The future is user-friendly, multiplayer and fast. Tools like Hypar and Motif are pushing things forward. From Autodesk, Forma stands out to me from a UX point of view. When we introduce it in the office, people pick it up right away and get to work, that’s what good UX should do. Now the challenge is keeping users: focus on what works, drop what doesn’t. AI isn’t just an idea anymore, it’s actually useful. And it was great to see Nick Cameron highlight the people behind our digital practice through the lens of Expand, Elevate, Educate, Execute.” “ Attending NXT BLD 2025 confirmed what we have sensed for a while: the BIM landscape is shifting. This is no longer incremental improvement—it’s a reinvention. The contrast with NXT BLD 2024 was striking. While NXT BLD 2024 introduced BIM 2.0, a broad exploration of future tech and AI possibilities, this year marked a decisive pivot. NXT BLD 2025 moved beyond ideation into execution. BIM 2.0 is no longer a future vision; it’s now being realized through tangible, usable tools. Startups are no longer in stealth or concept mode. They’re delivering credible, functioning alternatives to legacy platforms—solutions that reflect how interdisciplinary teams actually work today. These new tools feel lighter, more agile, and fundamentally smarter. They signal a broader industry move from document-heavy workflows toward fully data-centric ecosystems. AI naturally took centre stage—but this time as a deeply integrated force, not just a buzzword. From design augmentation to the automation of routine tasks, AI is being deployed to support and accelerate human decision-making—not replace it. This aligns closely with our thinking at Perkins&Will, where we see AI as an enabler of better design, not a substitute for it. ( Amplifying Creativity – NIck Cameron ) If NXT BLD 2024 was the introduction to BIM 2.0—highlighting cloud-native collaboration and interoperability—then 2025 revealed its maturing form, while also offering a glimpse into BIM 3.0: intelligent systems that adapt, optimize, and evolve through real-time data and digital twins. (it’s a tech conference—of course we need a new version number!) But beyond the tools, what stood out most was the tone. The AEC industry feels more open, aligned, and energized than ever. We’re not just modeling buildings—we’re modeling intelligence, relationships, and living systems. The future of BIM isn’t just smarter software—it’s a smarter, more connected industry. And it’s a future that strongly aligns with our values and aspirations at Perkins&Will’s Digital Practice Team.” David Sewell Sr Digital Prac Mgr Digital Practice Osman Sahinbozkir Digital Prac Spec II Digital Practice “Attending NXT BLD and NXT DEV this year, being immersed in the keynote presentations, product demos and expert forum discussions has been an invaluable experience, providing us all with key insights about the current state and the future of our fast-changing sector. My key takeaway from the discussions around BIM2.0, the disruptive abilities unlocked by AI, advancements in Open-source frameworks and how all these interact with the traditionally established norms of the industry is; keeping up with the Digital Transformation in AEC can no longer simply be about acquiring and using the newest tools on the market. It’s clear that in the current landscape, the boundaries between traditional vendor and user roles are dissolving, the resources for building complex tools are increasingly decentralized, the super-users of yesterday are becoming user-developers of today. This theme, which was echoed throughout the conference, implies to me that the competition will increasingly be about which organizations can more effectively cater for the rapidly evolving user-developer community.” “NXT BLD is one of the standout events in the calendar for BIM and AEC Digital Tools. Developed from AEC Mag which is a free publication where you can see the newest and improvements in the AEC Tech Landscape. This year was particularly fascinating and a definite improvement on last years showing. Last year it was “Coming Soon” or “This is a taste of what to come”, “This is what BIM 2.0 could look like…” now a lot of companies are raising the game and coming out of alpha and beta testing. Motif, Qonic, Snaptrude, Hyper, Arcol are just a few of the ones trying to compete with Autodesk for that no.1 BIM spot. It was a unique event for the AEC industry that focused more on collaborating and that distanced itself from company and project competitiveness but instead with a full focus on raising industry standards, building better, faster, safer whilst being more openness and datacentric. It was great to catchup with like minded individuals and share stories and reflect on seen presentations.” Adam Burnham Digital Prac Spec II Digital Practice Victor Barbosa Sr Digital Prac Mgr Digital Practice “Remember when you did a lot of work one day, and you forgot to press “save”? Or that occasion, you were working late with a teammate and when you finished your files conflicted when you tried to save them? Well, I was really excited to see Motif, Hypar, Forma and Arcol which do not have the save button . Wait? But how do I know when to save? You don’t have to. That’s solved. It’s always saved. What you see, is what your team sees and you can both work at the same time, no sync to central. I believe architects excel on collaboration, and finally modelling and drafting is gonna feel more like pin-up walls, or shall i say Miro boards?” “NXT BLD and NXT DEV 2025 were a great opportunity to get a clear view of the broader state of the industry and where it’s heading. It was also inspiring to explore the next generation of AEC technology up close. While many tools are still evolving, they’re becoming more advanced and professional with each iteration. The sessions offered valuable insight into the tech stacks and nuances of these platforms, helping us stay at the forefront as a practice.” Daniel Boba Computational Designer Digital Practice Previous Previous Previous Next Next Next 1 2 3 4 5 6 Open image in lightbox: IMG_4474 Open image in lightbox: IMG_4474 Open image in lightbox: IMG_4479 Open image in lightbox: IMG_4479 Open image in lightbox: IMG_4486 Open image in lightbox: IMG_4486 Open image in lightbox: Image (8) Open image in lightbox: Image (8) Open image in lightbox: Image (7) Open image in lightbox: Image (7) Open image in lightbox: Media (2) Open image in lightbox: Media (2)",

Whats a hackathon? “A hackathon is a collaborative, intensive event where individuals or teams come together to build software, applications, or other projects within a short time frame, typically 24 to 48 hours. The goal is often to develop a working prototype or proof-of-concept, focusing on problem-solving, skill-building, and networking. Create extensions, plugins, and innovative solutions while collaborating with a community of brilliant minds.” Previous Previous Previous Next Next Next 1 2 3 Open image in lightbox: Picture1 Open image in lightbox: Picture1 Open image in lightbox: Picture2 Open image in lightbox: Picture2 Open image in lightbox: Picture3 Open image in lightbox: Picture3 The focus of this year’s DevCon was Autodesk Platform Services (APS); which enables processing of the Data generated by widely used authoring tools and allow building bespoke applications through their integration into Cloud based services. As Autodesk summarizes it: “APS powers custom and pre-built applications, integrations, and innovative solutions. The growing set of APIs and services unlocks your Design and Make Data and connects workflows.” In line with this theme, the focus of the Hackathon was also around exploring and pushing the boundaries of the interconnectedness of the different tools by Autodesk through Dynamo, the visual programming interface that now powers an extended range of tools as well as a conduit that allows these tools to speak to one another. After 8 hours of intense coding by groups of experts focused on a theme, supported by the Developers of the very tools we were pushing the limits of; the outcome was an awe-inspiring series of technical explorations, working Proof of Concept tools developed by all teams, and overall, a mind-bendingly productive day with so many ideas to reflect and build on! Previous Previous Previous Next Next Next 1 2 Open image in lightbox: Picture4 Open image in lightbox: Picture4 Open image in lightbox: Picture5 Open image in lightbox: Picture5 The particular focus of Osman’s group was to develop a proof-of-concept tool in relation to the 10-minute city concept, score Walkability and expand Autodesk Forma’s Contextual Analysis capabilities. The team extracted context buildings’ massing of a geolocated project site from Forma (utilizing the Open-source OpenStreetMap datasets), reconstructed the context into natively editable Dynamo geometry, injected additional meta-data from external sources that are currently not natively available (such as land-use/typology and walkability) and then sorted/filtered based on these properties and built highlight/color override capabilities and shortest distance calculations directly in Forma. The proof of concept at the end of this effort was a working Script in Forma with Context buildings highlighted in color in the viewport based on their land-use/typology and the closest distance to any given Typology from the selected site. (i.e. the closest hospital: 45m). It was an incredible opportunity to meet and collaborate with Dynamo experts from around the world, and exchange innovative ideas with the team behind these awesome tools at Autodesk. The rigor with which our team pushed the capabilities of Forma’s Context Analysis capabilities were highly commended by the Autodesk team and it was a privilege to represent the Digital Practice Team at Perkins&Will in the big league among the best of the best. All coded natively in Dynamo, and more importantly, it worked!",

    "content": "Facades+ 2025: New York City, April 4-5 Last month, our Perkins&Will team headed to Facades+ in NYC—the premier conference on façades and building envelopes. Between inspiring keynotes, hands-on demonstrations, and spirited hallway conversations, and running our own computational design workshop, we came away energized by the industry’s drive to push material, performance, and computational boundaries. Here were some of our conference highlights and takeaways: Charlie Portelli iO Group Digital Practice “A team from RDH Building Science gave an interactive workshop where they discussed the different types of glass failure. The workshop covered topics ranging from spontaneous glass fracture due to nickel sulfide inclusions, delamination due to water infiltration. and edge protection for exposed edges. The team also supplied instruments used for measuring the amount of argon gas in an insulated glass unit (IGU) and moisture detection. It was a great experience to learn more about the science behind some of these failures and how minor tweaks in specifications can help mitigate these issues.” “AYON Studio presented a case study centered on their use of Vacuum Insulated Glazing (VIG) panels as replacement lites for an adaptive reuse / historical preservation project where the full window frame couldn’t be replaced. On-site thermal testing showed that VIG performed extremely well, reducing the overall U-value of the system by 75%. A team from Arup (including a sustainability consultant we are working with at BAT) presented their circular economy guidelines, which included redlist materials, design for disassembly, the creation of a post-consumer material economy, and a circular toolkit for NYEDC. The second half of the workshop was a group work session in which reused materials are proposed for a project, triggering new means of designing within a limited but broad set of materials.” Anish Reddy Project Architect Digital Practice Yash Akhouri Sust. Design Advisor Digital Practice Climate-Responsive Design and Energy Optimization “At this year’s Facades+ conference, discussions centered on how façade design can adapt to climate zones while reducing carbon impact and improving performance. In cold regions like Boston and Philly, triple glazing and dynamic shading systems (such as ETFE panels) were explored to balance solar control with energy efficiency. Marine and hot-humid climates emphasized natural ventilation and overhangs. Speakers highlighted the growing importance of energy modeling in meeting NYC’s updated energy codes and Local Law 97, with detailed simulations used to optimize envelope performance and avoid added costs. Case studies like Amherst College’s mass timber retrofit demonstrated how thoughtful sequencing and low-carbon material strategies can breathe new life into existing structures. A key takeaway: effective facade strategies must align with climate, code, and carbon—without over-optimizing at the expense of design integrity.” Our Workshop: Computational Geometry for Glass Façades I joined my colleagues, Anthony Samaha and Anish Reddy, in putting on a hands-on workshop in the “Technology: Research, Development, and Design Tools” track. Our two hour workshop looked at the York University School of Continuing Studies for inspiration and as a great example of leveraging computational design to help rationalizing a complex facade. We briefly spoke about the project to provide the group some context. We then dove in to the hands-on part: We walked through the design and creation of a parametric design surface We broke down the tools and logic (in this instance Rhino+Grasshopper) to help us understand what rationalizing geometry really means in context to project delivery Finally, we walked through how we can then take this rationalized geometry and fully panelize and document it in a way to coordinate with fabricators. As we got to the hands-on Grasshopper portion, two of us would walk through the rooms assisting anyone who ran into any script trouble.

Charlie Portelli, Perry Ashenfelter, Anthony Samaha, Anish Reddy, Yash Akhouri, Gigi Singh, Mario Romero Facades+ 2025 offered a powerful reminder of how collaboration, research, and hands-on experimentation continue to elevate building envelope design. From emerging materials and sustainability frameworks to the expanding role of computational workflows, the event sparked new ideas and renewed our commitment to innovation. We’re grateful to have shared our work—and to have learned so much from peers pushing the boundaries of façade performance, resilience, and beauty— and are also grateful for the local attendees that helped showcase the technological and technical acuity that Perkins&Will strives for.",

    "content": "Q2 Core eXchange Recap! Thank you to all our Presenters! View the Recordings on The Digital Practice Exchange Library During April’s Digital Practice Core eXchange, we welcomed an outstanding 1,604 participants across 11 dynamic sessions, featuring 26 presenters from across the firm and beyond. This quarter’s eXchange continued our mission of sharing expertise, elevating digital workflows, and fostering cross-disciplinary learning—with each session offering AIA CEU credit and a direct link to practice. Highlights from the week included a firmwide Earth Day Webcast presentation on April 22nd, an in-depth walkthrough of the Switch List tool, and continued development of our Best Practices series with updated guidance on Barrier-Free Design and Video Editing . We also reintroduced the Innovation Incubator Spotlight , showcasing two exciting projects coming out of our Minneapolis studio. New sessions explored emerging technologies and strategies, including a Keynote from Matteo Cominetti , Cofounder and COO of Speckle, a firm-focused presentation on Interoperability at Perkins&Will , and applied creative tools in Leveraging AI in Adobe . As always, all recordings and slide decks are archived in the Digital Practice eXchange Library for ongoing access and reference. We look forward to seeing everyone again in July for our Q3 eXchange! Theme Sessions: Interoperability in Practice April’s Digital Practice Core eXchange offered an inspiring look into the real-world application of digital tools and the future of data-driven collaboration. These themed sessions began with a dynamic presentation by the Chicago studio titled “Interoperability at Perkins&Will,” which spotlighted how teams are leveraging Rhino.Inside, Grasshopper, and Speckle to bridge software gaps across design, documentation, and fabrication. Through case studies ranging from responsive façades in Saudi Arabia to the digitally coordinated limestone panels of Ryan Field, presenters demonstrated how seamless tool integration enhances precision, preserves design intent, and empowers cross-disciplinary teams. Following this, keynote speaker Matteo Cominetti, cofounder of Speckle, expanded the conversation by exploring the broader vision of interoperability in AEC. Matteo shared how Speckle’s open-source, cloud-based platform is transforming collaboration by moving beyond files toward flexible, connected data ecosystems. His perspective illuminated how democratizing access to design data opens new possibilities for project delivery, analytics, and future AI-driven workflows. Together, these sessions underscored the critical role of connectivity in design practice and offered a compelling roadmap for evolving our digital processes. As always, the discussions are now available in the Digital Practice eXchange Library to inspire continued experimentation and innovation across the firm. Watch the keynote recording here Watch the Interoperability presentation recording here Interoperability Sessions Theme Sessions: Living Design Living Design Sessions During April’s Digital Practice Core eXchange—held in conjunction with Earth Day—we experienced a timely and urgent call to environmental action through the Earth Day Webcast, where keynote speaker Jason McLennan reflected on the planet’s ecological crisis and challenged designers to use their agency for measurable impact. Building on that momentum, the Core eXchange session, “Switch List: Ditch It and Switch It,” highlighted the firm’s internal leadership in material health, unveiling the updated Switch List and its app-based library. This collaborative effort empowers teams to phase out materials of concern and adopt healthier, market-available alternatives across product categories—from flooring and sealants to upholstery and insulation. Together, these two events reinforced Perkins&Will’s commitment to aligning design excellence with ecological and human health. As both sessions are now available in the Digital Practice Library, they serve as a springboard for deeper integration of sustainable practices across our firm.

    "content": "With spring hitting us in the northern hemisphere it felt like time to share all the new Hub features that have been blooming over the last couple months.  We are always making small improvements to many of the Hub apps on a regular basis.   This is primarily done through all of your ideas given to us through the black feedback button on the right side of each page.   Thank you to all of you who think to contribute to small daily progress to make our single source of truth and information better. Some of the larger updates listed below continue to find ways to make the organization and discovery of basic important information about our people, projects, and clients easier for everyone through Hub. In early spring we added some minor but important usability functions to our home page of Hub.   You will notice the apps or organized into various categories.   You can use the pin next to the all section, favorites or any of the others to have that be your own personal default starting point in Hub based on what you are personally most focused on.   There is also a star in the upper left corner of every app icon so you can create your own favorites list.   We also have some apps already favorited for everyone since our firm and business is our people doing projects for our clients. People app – major updates A few weeks ago we rolled out a major update to the people app.   The first reason for doing this was to get it on the same modern technology and code that most of our recent apps run off of.   In addition to this and other backend improvements we have a list of new features and functions. We have more information for you and more basic information that you can share with the firm to help run the business and find the right people for the right tasks quicker. Please take a few minutes and hit the edit my profile button at the top of the people app right now to go and share what languages you speak, any awards you have personally won, any outreach or speaking engagements you have been a part of or any publications you have been in.  You can also share an audio of the pronunciation of your name or your pronouns.    The about me section allows you to share who you are as a person with the firm while the RFP profile is a workflow with your marketing teams to prep our resume content we share in pursuit of work.   Finally a reminder that some of the information is updated and comes from our UKG platform and we spell that out from the edit my profile page. You will notice a few new tabs at the top of the people app now that shows how groups of people relate.  The first one shows the leadership, business teams, and champions at the studio levels so you know who does what in your own studio or in another you are visiting. The third tab at the top showcases the firmwide groups and councils we have that lead up various aspects of running our firm.   From these views of each council you can download single images of all the people in the group through a settings button in the upper right.   We are keeping these lists of people updated on the backend as we work with each council chair to identify their team and their purpose and strategic actions year after year. Practice Toolkit Back at the beginning of the year we introduced the practice toolkit as a single location to aggregate all the information we were collecting about each practice in one spot from all the various apps and locations in Hub that it was entered.   This also introduced places for general knowledge, a calendar of events, key clients, top 10 lists and overall goals and progress practice by practice.   We are working to also do the same for our different disciplines as well. The Switch List Hopefully you heard a few weeks ago on Earth Day that we transitioned our material approach from ‘precautionary’ to positive action, utilizing the market’s readily available alternatives.   This new app was showcased on the last Core eXchange has updated internal program guide, new vetted materials library and app, new guides for project partners and product manufacturers, and review of project requirements. We continue to also update and introduce other small improvements and apps like DEAR process updates Transcendent Detail Competition App More collaboration features in Pipeline Client & Consultant app org relationship features AI features in the Strategic Action Plan app We continue to prep more updates to PMTK, Studio Staffing, Pipeline and Portfolio as we do a lot of background work to make this move to Deltek VantagePoint successful.   Keep engaging all of our apps on Hub to enrich the knowledge and information available for many different workflows and needs on our single source of truth, Hub.",

    "content": "Design, Disruption, and the Future We Choose Dive into AI with Matt Krissel on the Design of AI Podcast On the Design for AI podcast, I explored what it means to be an architect in this era of rapid technological disruption—and why design matters more than ever. We live in a world obsessed with speed and surface appeal. Yet the built environment does more than exist as something to be optimized—it shapes our values, culture, movement, experinces and sense of belonging. If we don’t pause to ask better questions, we come up short and risk creating environments that separate rather than connect. This isn’t merely a design failure—it’s a failure of imagination, intentionality, and culture. In these early days of generative AI over-indexing on image generation, with fast imagery and seductive forms, we risk mistaking the output for insight. “They are fast, but not always good. Provocative, but not meaningful. Seductive but not compelling. There is no causality to the image and the reality it suggests.” Provocative isn’t the same as meaningful, and speed without values is just noise. As I shared, the real promise of AI isn’t faster rendering (though helpful—is this what we want from an emerging superpower?)—it’s deeper thinking, new ways of making, and increasing agility, our reach, and our capacity. As we seek to seperate the vital few from the trivial many, design should help us turn down the volume and tune into what matters. Design software is a vast ecosystem of general-purpose tools and highly technical, complex, bespoke software, and we rely on people to move across this messy landscape of methods. Right now, the gains from AI workflows are incremental, in silos of productivity burst from the tools of the moment. We must evolve past “hot-rodding” our old workflows as the most viable path forward. This isn’t just automating what we already do —it’s about reimagining what we do, how we do it, and with whom. The real gains will likely be in how we organize ourselves and work in ways we have not yet invented, in the choices we make in how we orient our gains, in expanding our fluidity between intuition and computation, and in seeing AI more as a creative partner than only a tool. But we need to be intentional. In this fog of AI frenzy, there’s a danger of tools leading the process instead of values. Software in search of problems rarely serves the public good. As Peter Drucker warned, “There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.” Efficiency cannot be the goal as it’s too easily misapplied. Design is inherently inefficient. That’s not a flaw—in many ways, it’s a feature. While everyone wants to move faster, we need to be critical of where we speed up and where we should actually slow down. The outcomes and impact are too significant and lasting for a one-size-fits-all, speed-at-all-cost approach. Some things need to gestate. We need the friction, the debate, the pauses, the rethinking. Design is more than a means to an end—it’s our agency in action. If we sacrifice the rigor of that process in favor of chasing speed alone, we’ll fill our world with buildings that feel like first drafts—rushed, underdeveloped, functional, maybe, but forgettable. In times of rapid change, we want to focus on ‘first principles’ and be less concerned about specificity and more concerned about trajectory. In other words, we should be clear on the vision and loose on the details to ensure we aim in the right direction, aligning our resources, intellect, and grit with the flexibility to correct course as technology develops. We must embrace our agency and position to design the future of practice to ensure a future we actually want to live in. Matthew Krissel Design Principal, Practice Leader Digital Practice",

    "content": "Artificial Intelligence in Architecture Salon 1: Value/Values Last month, Perkins&Will was invited by the AIA New York Future of Practice committee to discuss at the “Artificial Intelligence in Architecture (AI+A) Salon 1: Value/Values,” a series aimed at bridging the gap between AECO practice and the explorations in AI’s potential. As part of a four-part series, this session featured Charles Portelli from the New York studio, alongside Dan Reynolds from Walter P. Moore, and Murat Melek from Suffolk Construction. These panelists represented the three primary sectors of the built environment, contributing to an informed discussion that cut through the hype around AI. They emphasized how professionals could leverage technology to enhance design and problem-solving without replacing human ingenuity. The discussion was moderated by Elizabeth Bowie Christoforetti, Assistant Professor at Harvard GSD, focusing on three key questions: What are your hopes and fears vis-à-vis AI integration in the field? How will it change our skills? How will it challenge our expertise? “AI has the potential to simplify our lives. For instance, the convenience of having one’s calendar automatically updated after booking a flight or hotel is a small but powerful example of seamless integration. Similarly, AI can enable smoother, more contemporary project delivery methods by focusing on data rather than files. By breaking down data silos and integrating various sources, designers can uncover previously unforeseen insights, leading to better-informed decisions. These decisions can have a positive impact on both the environment and human well-being.” Charles Portelli, AIA, RIBA, CDT Digital Innovation Strategist at Perkins&Will “At Suffolk Construction, AI is being harnessed to enhance knowledge accessibility for site teams, enabling them to make quicker, more informed decisions and adapt to unexpected site conditions. Improved supply chain management can reduce downtime and waste while controlling costs. With access to larger, cleaner, and fuller datasets, the construction industry can use AI to streamline scheduling, estimating, and preconstruction processes. Understanding the unique risks associated with each project can inform the selection of subcontractors who are best suited for the specific conditions, setting the project on a path to success.” Murat Melek, PhD, SE Director of Design AI at Suffolk Construction “Engineering faces unique challenges, and AI offers the opportunity to transform “hindsight 20/20″ into foresight, providing engineers with preemptive insights to prevent issues before they arise. This proactive approach allows for greater creativity and the ability to solve high-impact problems. By eliminating unnecessary obstacles like data access, AI can enhance speed and efficiency. With the ability to manage larger, more complex datasets, engineers can improve optioneering by considering more alternatives.” Dan Reynolds AI Leader at Walter P Moore The panel concluded that AI offers significant benefits across all AECO sectors. Echoing the sentiment “with great power comes great responsibility,” they urged industry professionals to drive innovation by leveraging their expertise to shape AI’s integration into practice.",

Topics ranged from 3D printing and other digital fabrication methods to a range of innovative workflows that incorporate Artificial Intelligence. Their presentation, entitled ‘Case Study of an Integrated Parametric Approach in Affordable Housing’ highlighted the Corazon del Valle 180 unit affordable housing project executed by our Los Angeles studio. Parametric and computational methods were utilized throughout the life of the project, creating a highly detailed and responsive design. Building forms were sculpted in smooth curves to guide wind through an interior courtyard. Masses were subdivided into an optimized unit mix and facade elements were parametrically located according to spacing rules. All these elements were coordinated in a complex generative script so a change to one element would ripple through the creation and location of the rest. For more information about the Corazon del Valle project reach out to August Miller in the Los Angeles studio. To stay up to date with all the computational design efforts at Perkins&Will join us on our bi-weekly community calls on Tuesdays or send a message to the entire community on the Computational Design Teams channel .

    "content": "IFMA World Workplace 2024 Recap Showing off our Data Analytics Tools to Potential Clients Last month Leigh Stringer, Brad Rogers, and I presented Using Data Analytics to Drive Real Estate Consolidation at the IFMA World Workplace Conference & Expo in San Antonio, TX. We were excited for the opportunity to speak with this particular audience about our capabilities with managing data and using it to help our clients solve problems that look to optimize the use of their facilities and assets. We presented several case studies that were all at different scales and using different tools with different types of clients.  One example showed how we use Area Sync to extract design data from our digital apps on a single corporate interiors project, while another showed off our Campus Planner tool with a higher ed client that handles data from multiple facilities along with other client data. What we found from the questions and dialog from audience members after the presentation is that the pain points are real when it comes to organizing data from different systems or sources. Some are working within typical FM applications (like Maximo) that don’t connect with other data sources in the organizations, and that information tends to be siloed for them. Some expressed that the BIM data coming from the design or construction team isn’t always in a format for their FM apps to receive it. The feedback from our case studies and holistic approach to our projects was very positive and well received. We think there are opportunities out there to provide digital advisory services for our existing clients. If you think a client might need these services, please feel free to reach out to Leigh, Brad, or myself. We would be happy to speak with clients or project teams if needed, or provide some marketing materials to help facilitate the conversation. In the meantime, we will continue to look for other opportunities like IFMA to share our processes and tools with a larger audience of potential clients.",

    "content": "AEC Tech 2024 NYC AEC Tech is an annual conference hosted in New York by Thornton Tomasetti, marking its 12 th consecutive year. Unlike typical conferences, AEC Tech stands out for its focus on practitioner-driven content in computational design. This multi-day includes in-person and virtual workshops, Tech Tour, Tech Crawl, symposium, and hackathon attracting AEC professionals rooted in the computational design space from across the globe, as far east as Japan and as far west as LA and Vancouver. Being the event is hosted by practitioners, the whole ethos behind the event is rooted in practitioners sharing insights from their daily workflows and solutions stemming from their challenges and showcasing successes. Every year the event has an exceptional line up of speakers and attendees. This year’s event was no different including speakers such as Shajay Bhooshan, associate director & Head of Computation & Design at ZHA, Dimitrie Stefanescu, founder & CEO of Speckle, Andrew Heumann creator of Human UI grasshopper plugin, and Mostapha Sadeghipour Doudsari co-founder of Ladybug tools and many others. In recent past, individuals such as Nick Cameron and Charles Portelli have presented. Attendees are typically practitioners stemming from firms who are leaders in the AEC Technology space and on occasion a few aspiring students who want to break into the domain. This year Perkins&Will made its presence felt by having several folks attend not just the symposium but also the workshops and hackathon. The Tech Tours offered an inside look at recent NYC architectural projects, led by architects directly involved in the work, allowing for candid behind-the-scenes insights. In 2023 Perkins&Will New York Studio participated in the Tech Craw by opening its doors to showcase its approach to technology and innovation – a fantastic opportunity for firms to highlight their expertise. Previous Previous Previous Next Next Next 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 The Hackathon A hackathon is a fast-paced event where architects, engineers, and construction professionals team up to solve industry challenges mostly by using technology. Over a short period teams get together to brainstorm and build innovative solutions—like software tools or digital workflows—that tackle real problems in design, construction, or building management. It’s all about collaboration, creativity, and pushing boundaries to improve the AEC industry. This hackathon took place over the course of 26 hours from Saturday October 26th through to Sunday morning. With approximately 80-100 participants ideas were thrown around in a lightning round to see what sort of teams could form and by that morning we had coalesced into 10 separate teams; 5 of which had Perkins&Will folks. Anthony Samaha Laszlo Andrasi Karth Gopinath Previous Previous Previous Next Next Next 1 2 3 Over the course of 26 hours, each team focused on working through their hack and assembling a pitch deck. There were 4 awards categories: Best overall Hacker’s Choice Most Collaborative Team Most First Time Hackers Team Perkins&Will walked away with both the Most Collaborative and Best Overall! Take a look at each of the hacks that our PW teams were able to put together in such a short amount of time. Previous Previous Previous Next Next Next 1 2 3 D-AI-LOG “All-nighters at 32 hit different than all-nighters at 22.” — Luke Gehron , Boston Studio Equalizer “Hackathons give off the same energy as fast burn competitions. There’s an intense, manic act of creation within a short timeframe and nothing really compares to that. That’s the great thing about these: they’re for everyone, across all disciplines and skillsets, and are the perfect environment to test wild ideas.” — Mario Romero , Chicago Studio Imprint “It was amazing to be able to present the idea I internally thought was totally insane and have 8 other people tell you they’d like to fix the problem you have because they think its a good idea.” — Anthony Samaha , New York Studio Splash “Hackathons provide a unique opportunity to join a team of complete strangers and dive into a problem. This being my first hackathon experience, I was impressed with how quickly teams reached a flow state and solved complex problems. I look forward to applying this learning experience in future collaborative efforts.” — Laszlo Andrasi , Chicago Studio UpZone “It was a great team experience that was reflected in the success of our hack at combining very different digital workflows into a cohesive application.” — Anish Reddy , New York Studio Lastly, we’d like to leave you with one image that we felt encompassed the spirit of this AEC Tech",

    "content": "Introducing Revit 2025 New features and improvements in Revit since 2023 We’re thrilled to announce the release of Revit 2025! It has been two years since we have upgraded our Revit version after the unprecedented version skip of 2024. We are very excited to be able to now take advantage of all the new features added to the program over the last two years. Below is a list of some of the most impactful and notable changes you can look forward to. There is also a link with a slide deck looking at some of the features we think are the most relevant to how we work in Revit at PW. Finally, at the end of the article are a few links pointing to the Autodesk change logs and a few other forums noting all of the changes to Revit in the past two versions if you care to take a deeper dive. As of Monday, November 4th, Revit 2025 will be available for you to install on Company Portal for you to install. After the official rollout of Revit 2025, all new projects will be started in this version of Revit; all updates to firmwide content and templates will also be in this version of Revit. Existing projects may choose to upgrade on a per project basis. If you have questions or wish to discuss upgrading your project, reach out to your local Design Applications Manager, or post in the Digital Practice General Channel . So, what changed? Improvements to the interface… The most noticeable changes are to the interface including: Modern Dark mode that now matches your system theme, with an easy-t0-use switch back to light mode to check how your drawings will look. Also includes true color conversation so everything looks good and is legible in both themes. Updates to the Revit home screen now include displaying all projects you have access to and which version of Revit are associated with that project. Tabbed project browser allowing for easier navigation; search at the top of the project browser. New Manage Links window now displays all links in a categorized list format making it much easier to manage your links than the old tabbed layout. Improvements to modeling… There have been some long-awaited changes to the modeling tools, including: Topo surfaces are now Topo Solids, making basic situations like tunnels and undercuts that were always very hard to model rather easy. In addition, Topo Solids look much better when cut and rendered. Wall joints and wraps are now easier to control. Curtain wall mullions now allow for multiple closed loops in the sketch, which can open all sorts of creative solutions and more detailed designs. Improvements to documenting… There are also some changes to the tools we use to document and annotate including: Sheet Collection now allow for the same sheet number to repeated in the same module under separate sheet collections, allowing for better management of multiple sets or permits in a project without having to create separate documentation models or creative uses drawing number separators. Text notes and keynotes can FINALLY be easily aligned with multi align to make those sheet notes and details look clean without all the reference planes and extra detail lines. Scope boxes now have a height parameter allowing them to be better controlled. Revisions can now be set on multiple sheets at once without any 3rd party add-ins. Revision Clouds can now be schedule natively without any 3rd party add-in. Printing and Exporting tasks can now be run the background, allowing you to continue to work while the task is running. These are just some of the improvements and updates we think will be most impactful for you as you design and document, there are many more which you can discover in the embedded PowerPoint above, and in the links below.

    "content": "For nine decades, Perkins&Will has navigated numerous technological advancements in architectural design and delivery. In this rapidly evolving era of Artificial Intelligence (AI ) and Machine Learning (ML), we understand its impact on our profession. We have a measured approach when evaluating potentially disruptive innovation—we are not ones to chase the next “shiny object.” This strategy allows us to bypass the hype and focus on studying what will transform our profession. We know that today’s AI is not yet capable of independently generating architectural design solutions. However, in its current form, AI can automate repetitive and mundane tasks. It has the potential to amplify the creativity of design professionals, elevate design excellence, and contribute to a more sustainable and resilient built environment. Perkins&Will has been actively exploring AI’s possibilities through global webinars, hackathons, and thought leadership efforts. Our webinars featuring keynote speakers Phil Bernstein and Mehdi Nourbakhsh have reached thousands of participants worldwide. Internally, we have run over 30 AI experiments, applying cutting-edge technologies to real-world design challenges and contributing to internal knowledge and industry innovation. As we embrace these advancements, maintaining ethical standards becomes paramount. Maintaining Ethical Standards As impactful as AI is becoming, innovation must be balanced with an awareness of the inherent biases within these recent technologies. Early in our discovery phase, we published guidelines to help those curious about experimenting with AI. The main message was “trust but verify.” This is due to the fact that widely available AI tools are often designed to satisfy the user, generating “hallucinated” results—outputs that seem plausible but are incorrect. We learned that AI models are trained on historical and perhaps outdated data sets and from various sources across the Internet, which may perpetuate outdated design norms and biases. We ask our designers to seek feedback from their teammates and disclose to our clients the areas in our design process that use Generative AI. With clear guidelines and transparency, we can have AI help enhance our projects without compromising quality or ethical standards. Amplify Creativity Some AI technologies are incredibly powerful and accessible, aiding us in addressing persistent challenges in the design and delivery process. With AI and ML embedded in our custom tools and workflows, our designers can focus on the problems our clients entrust us to solve—problems that require human creativity. These rapidly evolving technologies are relatively easy to incorporate into our custom tool development. Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at categorizing information, enabling the automation of repetitive and mundane tasks. These “boring” tasks often slow our design teams down and prevent them from focusing on creative problem-solving for our clients. By implementing AI-enabled tools, we effectively “make time” so our teams can concentrate on delivering innovative and healthier design solutions to our clients. Integrating AI into Our Design Process Building upon the firm’s history, culture, and evolving AI guidelines, our colleagues began exploring, experimenting, and sharing their findings. Their work helped to craft a strategy for developing AI-enabled applications and design workflows. By focusing on practical, readily achievable solutions, we have avoided much of the inflated expectations surrounding these technologies and have become more confident in developing solutions that help our design teams to, as Pixar co-founder Ed Catmull said, “be wrong as fast as they can.” We have built several AI tools, including an iterative rendering application. Unlike conventional rendering engines and early text-prompt generative AI tools, this tool produces images ranging from stylized illustrations to photorealistic renderings generated from simple massing models, including site context. It allows the designer to make incremental changes to specific aspects of the generated image without requiring a wholesale change—a limitation of earlier generative AI tools. This iterative function increases the tool’s value while accelerating early conceptual design explorations. Another tool, affectionately called Chato (Portuguese for “boring”), performs data assurance and validation tasks that are often considered tedious. Chato enhances design data by comparing, correcting, and aligning room, department, and space type names across various sources—including space programs, Building Information Models (BIMs), and additional data sources like cost, material, and carbon information. Chato has the potential to unlock BIM’s long-held promises by addressing the “garbage in—garbage out” problem. For instance, Chato replaces the repetitive and mundane tasks of completing program variance reports, counting space names on PDFs, and manually updating Excel reports. By automating these tasks, Chato frees our designers to apply their creative talents more effectively to solve client challenges. Rework can be minimized by ensuring data accuracy with Chato. Automating these mundane tasks increases efficiency and enhances job satisfaction by allowing our designers to engage more deeply with the creative aspects of their work. Human Collaboration Remains Essential AI will not replace what gifted designers can create; instead, it amplifies their talents. By automating repetitive tasks, we enhance our ability to deliver exceptional results to our clients. Our goal is to elevate our work without sacrificing the “magic” of the human collaborative process, resulting in a unique and meaningful built environment. Only designers can conceptualize spaces that respond to human experiences. Based on the research and experimentation we have completed thus far, we are confident that AI will bring tremendous value to our design processes. Rather than eliminating jobs, AI will create time for designers to focus on more fulfilling, high-level creative tasks, enhancing job satisfaction while producing innovative solutions for our clients. Through responsible AI integration, we can enhance creativity, improve efficiency, and uphold our commitment to excellence. As we continue to develop custom tools and refine our strategy, our overarching goal remains unchanged: to amplify creativity, elevate design excellence, and deliver a more sustainable and resilient built environment.",

    "content": "Being Inspired by Our Colleagues’ Applied Innovation At the start of this year the Digital Practice team launched a pilot program to tap into the innovative digital solutions our colleagues across the firm were creating and experimenting with to deliver design excellence to our clients. This program, aptly named Inspire , has fostered the exchange of cutting-edge ideas focused on delivering new value to our clients through digital innovation. Each week, digital innovators from across the firm present concepts ranging from new app pitches to advancements in workflows, technologies, and more. These fast-paced and open sessions offer an opportunity for everyone involved to share feedback, explore possibilities, and find new ways to enhance our client offerings. More than just presentations, Inspire encourages collaboration and experimentation with the aim of showcasing fresh ideas that could transform how we approach project and design challenges. Thus, creating a ripple effect of creativity throughout our firm. Since mid-January, over 30 presentations have been shared, many of which have been captured on the Hub’s Digital Board , accessible to everyone across the firm. You can explore the ideas and projects developed as part of Inspire here: Inspire Projects I have been genuinely inspired by the innovative spirit of our colleagues and the energy this program has sparked across the firm. I’ve learned how accessible many of the tools for custom tool-building are, including large language models and diffusion models. While I may not “write” code in the traditional sense, I’ve been telling others that I can “make” it with the aid of ChatGPT, Streamlit, and a dash of YouTube tutorials. As we continue to hear about new innovations and invite more colleagues to share their work in our Inspire sessions, we’re also focused on taking these innovations further—whether by integrating them into our projects or pushing for additional development. By implementing these solutions, we’re confident that we’ll continue to deliver greater value and digital services that differentiate Perkins&Will from the competition. Thanks to the many who have Inspired me over the course of this year and who I’m certain will continue to do so in the future: Adam Burnham Digital Practice Anthony Samaha Digital Practice Daniel Boba Digital Practice Daniel Prager Digital Practice Dustin Schipper Digital Practice Ellen Berglund Digital Practice Elton Gjata Digital Practice Eric Taylor Digital Practice Harish Palani Digital Practice Isabela Granado Digital Practice Jason Pieper Digital Practice Jordana de Castro Rosa Digital Practice Lincoln Jyo Digital Practice Laszlo Andrasi Digital Practice Luke Gehron Digital Practice Mario Romero Digital Practice Nirvik Saha Digital Practice Preston Pape Digital Practice Qin Lin Digital Practice Spyros Ampanavos Digital Practice Stephen Grant Digital Practice Ugonna Ohakim Digital Practice Victor Barbosa Digital Practice Will Franklin Digital Practice Zuzanna Czapla Digital Practice",

    "content": "Confluence Lexington Kentucky, September 12, 2024 In mid-September, Perkins&Will was invited to speak at the exclusive Confluence conference in Lexington Kentucky, hosted by Avail. The intimate gathering brought together industry leaders from renowned firms like SHoP Architects, Olson Kundig, Thornton Tomasetti, and Wade Trim, all of whom are considered to be at the forefront of design technology advancement in the AEC industry. The conference theme focused on “Progress in AI and ML,” exploring how firms are leveraging these technologies to address evolving industry challenges. Perkins&Will’s presentation centered on ongoing projects developed by our I/O and Digital Practice teams: Project Insight, Generator, and Comfy UI. Project Insight Project Insight led by Nirvik Saha out of the Boston studio, utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze 3D models and project documents. This allows designers to easily surface and access relevant project information within their daily workflow. Generator Generator was a project developed by Thomas Kearns and Aprameya Pandit out of the Chicago studio, harnesses natural language processing and sentiment analysis during project meetings to generate an image gallery, capturing the meeting’s energy. Comfy UI Elton Gjata from the Vancouver studio spearheaded the implementation of Comfy UI within Perkins&Will. Comfy UI allows designers to utilize text to image generation AI within the safety and security of Perkins&Will client’s confidentiality requirements. The event provided valuable insights into how other firms are integrating AI and a glimpse into future technologies designers can expect to utilize. We were inspired by discussions on topics ranging from automatic tagging and categorizing of 3D models to image enhancements and automated entourage scene population for presentation renderings. Chaos group shared their plans for using AI in near future Shipping now Image Enhancer for Enscape 4.1 – allows for crisper and added detail to images in a faction of the time In Beta now: Gaussian Splat support coming to V-Ray 7 It allows to see shadows and reflection of virtual environment as an object in your rendered model . AI Material Generation, starting with Vray-7 Coming in 2025: Lifestyle Image generation for Cylindo Automatic scene population Conference was hosted by Avail, our partner for Revit Content Management We had very productive pre-conference and post-conference meetings where we discussed and together prioritized Perkins&Will  improvements requests. We hope to see some of them implemented in the next release During the conference Avail shared their research into using AI to automatically recognize objects from preview image and tag them. Here are some examples of this research.",

    "content": "Introducing Palette (Open BETA) The knowledge gateway for design excellence We’re thrilled to announce the soft opening of the Palette tool. Palette is the entry point to knowledge and design workflows across Perkins&Will – aligned to how projects are conceptualized and delivered. It brings together expertise and experience from every corner of Perkins&Will. Palette is a living resource – always evolving with new knowledge and expertise that reflects Perkins&Will’s diverse interests and expertise. New cards will continue to be added. We’re working hard to collect and document all of this knowledge in the Palette tool. In the meantime we wanted to open the platform up for feedback. We want to hear from you! How can I use Palette? As a knowledge Gateway Palette can be used as a topic-based directory offering a single point of reference for knowledge built across the firm. It provides a summary of knowledge collected across different practice areas and connects this to research, micro-knowledge, digital practice, and expertise. To stimulate new perspectives We have found that using a pre-selection of Palette cards as a basis for discussion in design charrettes stimulates a broader consideration of impacts and opportunities than a brief is likely to provide. Used as a discussion tool, they often help elicit perspectives from quieter members of the group by providing topics for reflection and, in many cases, producing new project-specific considerations by associating the card topics to the specific design challenge. We recommend using the cards as impact filters as a way of critiquing RFQs and briefs and, from the earliest design stages, creating a set of impact-focused lenses from which to evaluate designs. To ensure a holistic set of considerations have been applied to the project In a rapidly changing industry, methods of best practice, sustainable impact and reporting are becoming increasingly complex. Palette offers a way to capture new developments across our practice areas and connect these topics to expertise across the firm. When do I use Palette? Pre-Design Context and question cards can be used throughout the design process, but are often useful to reflect against briefs and stakeholder requirements, to understand where risks and dilemmas may arise, and to stimulate perspectives on how to frame or approach the project. Before exploring options After the brief has been analyzed, and contextual drawings and models are produced, we often use Context, Question and Quality and Process cards in a charrette to reflect on how we might approach our design investigations, and how the concepts discussed might be anchored in the physical site. At each review The topics and methods proposed by the cards are typically revisited at reviews as a way of gauging the relative success of each design proposition. In project planning Methods and processes carry estimates of time require to engage with a particular workflow, and the champions that can be staffed to assist your team. To organize reporting Palette cards are connected to certifications, our design excellence framework, DEAR and the UN-Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG) framework. Integration of Palette cards in the design process makes it easier and faster to report and generate data for these frameworks. This can be powerful in defending a design for impact or calculating points for a certification award. We Want to Hear from You! Your feedback is vital to us. Let us know how Palette can further improve your workflow and make project delivery smoother. Thank You! — for your ongoing support. Stay tuned for more updates and exciting features in the coming months. Best Regards, The Palette Team",

A project site in Austin, Texas, is home to several heritage trees. Every effort must be made to preserve these trees, with special attention given to heritage and protected trees during the design phase. Due to their significance, it is essential to digitally capture the current state of these trees. This digital reference will provide valuable context and inform the design process, ensuring the trees are properly considered and preserved. The process involved acquiring the point cloud from the GC, the scans were made using NAVVIS and the program allowed us to crop the point cloud data to the required area and download as .e57 file. The Downloaded point cloud data was about 3 Gigabytes in file size.

To begin with the point cloud data points needs to be reduced for the processing purposes. Through the use of grasshoppers reduce cloud points option a major reduction in the point cloud data has been made. The resulting mesh had more number of mesh faces which makes its difficult to export and make it into a Revit family, further processing of the mesh is done in rhino cleaning the faces and using the reduce mesh command the mesh density is reduced to about 20 percent.

    "content": "The Speckle Hackathon, Beyond the Speckleverse , took place online from June 7th to 9th. Designed for innovators in the AEC realm, it pushed the boundaries of creativity and technology. We are thrilled to announce that we have two project winners: ark is the best overall winner, along with AI2Speckle winning by votes. ARK Our project aimed to sympathise with the smaller AEC companies, the start-ups, and the freelancer to see if we can potentially reduce the cost of hosting on CDE Platforms like BIM360 and buying software licenses. We used Speckle’s open-source features to create a much cheaper alternative. How it works? You are able to drag and drop Rhino and Revit files directly into the website. The files are automatically converted to Speckle objects and you are able to view them on the web app, no software needed. In the future we also aim to automatically print and display the drawing sets that are saved in the 3dm and RVT model. What can we use it for? We often receive historical files from our clients that are saved in software versions we do not have access to. Now we can open them and retrieve geometry and drawings without the need of actually ever opening Revit or Rhino. Watch ark demo here! or try it here: https://www.arkhive.digital/ Although Beyond the Speckleverse was an online hackathon we had a chance to meet in person in SHL Copenhagen office. Our ark team were Victor Wanderley Barbosa, Daniel Boba, Adam Burnham, Ellen Berglund and Zuzanna Czapla – we had a lot of fun working together! AI2Speckle Bridging the AI-BIM Gap The architectural design process is evolving rapidly with generative AI tools like Dall-E, and Midjourney. These tools generate stunning visuals from various sources, enhancing creativity and design exploration. However, the challenge remains: translating these AI visuals into actionable BIM data. AI2Speckle addresses this gap. Our Mission AI2Speckle empowers architects and interior designers by integrating AI with BIM workflows. Our solution: Extracts material information (textures, finishes) from AI-generated images. Streamlines material selection by suggesting materials based on AI renders . Enhances design exploration with diverse material combinations within the BIM environment. Promotes collaboration by ensuring consistency between AI renderings and BIM models. And soon it will incorporate a vast library of high-quality 3D elements directly from AI renderings into BIM models. Watch AI2Speckle demo here! or try it here: https://ai2speckle.netlify.app/ Our Inspiration The idea for AI2Speckle originated from the need to bridge the gap between stunning AI renders and actionable BIM data. By leveraging Speckle, we created a seamless workflow that extracts materials from AI-generated images and integrates them back into 3D models. Celebrating Our Success We are thrilled to announce that our project, AI2Speckle, won the Speckle Hackathon by votes! This victory is dedicated to the incredible support we received throughout this journey. Our team—Josie Harrison, Marwan Elzainy, Abhishek Shinde, and myself, Jordana de Castro Rosa—came together with amazing synergy. Special thanks to Perkins&Will, especially Victoria Partridge Walsh, for their unwavering support.",

    "content": "The Problem: Slow PDF Prints Printing PDF’s from Revit has never been exciting, easy, or a particularly quick process. Clarity servers and other automation tools have helped us publish more easily along the way but still takes time, setup, and maintenance. Ultimately, getting to our drawing sets has still presented pain points. ‘Print’ Fast with sPrint Envisioned at a 2023 joint Perkins&Will/Autodesk hackathon, sPrint leverages the the work we already do (that is, publishing our models to BIM360) and let’s you easily download each sheet in your published model as full-on Vector-based PDFs at their correct and appropriate sheet sizes and not in hours or tens of minutes but within seconds. How Does sPrint Work? sPrint was developed as a Chrome and Edge-compatible extension. Install it on your browser! That lives in your browser and allows you to export PDF sheets in your published Revit model as a .zip file containing all of the sheets you chose to ‘print’! Getting Started with sPrint Making Sure sPrint is Installed sPrint should already be installed in both Chrome and Edge on your laptops. If it’s not immediately visible then you may need to show all of your extensions From here, we recommend you pin sPrint. If you still do not see you, feel free to install it from this Chrome Web Store link . ‘Printing’ Your Project PDFs You’ll need to login with your Perkins&Will Autodesk account first Click on the Allow button Then, on BIM360 open a published Revit project model that contains sheets Click on sPrint to get a drop down of available sheets. Select your sheet and click on Export The Export button will start spinning and after a few moments you’ll get a notification that the PDFs are being downloaded Troubleshooting sPrint is under constant development and we’re fixing bugs and adding features every week. Sometimes you’ll find the export button continue to spin. If this happens you can simply click out of sPrint and re-start the export. This usually clears things up. We’ve also discovered a potential issue with blank text in our title blocks extending the sheet size. If you notice this on your sheets, check out this mK to fix the issue.",

    "content": "Confluence NYC: New York, April 17 In April, Perkins&Will was invited to speak at Confluence NYC at the Brooklyn Navy Yards, hosted by our friends at Avail . Perkins & Will had the opportunity to share the spotlight with influential firms such as SHoP, Thornton Tomasetti, and Woods Bagot. All of whom are considered as industry leaders in the AEC technology field. The event focused on the ever-evolving popular topic of AI and ML in the AEC industry showcasing how various firms are integrating advanced technologies into their practice. Members of the I / O group, Charlie Portelli from the NY studio and Nirvik Saha from the Boston studio co-presented the latest AI developments happening at Perkins&Will, highlighting four key initiatives being developed by the broader digital team at the firm: Chat-o, RevitMine, Generator, and ComfyUI. RevitMine The RevitMine effort spearheaded by Nirvik allows us to run a BIM deliverable through a Large Language Model (LLM) and ask it questions. Think of ChatGPT for 3D models. Generator Generator was a project developed by Thomas Kearns and Aprameya Pandit which focuses on stitching together various frameworks to generate a curated gallery of images based on speech. Comfy UI Elton Gjata researched ComfyUI as an interface that allows designers to use text to image generation safely, without sharing sensitive data publicly. This effort takes into account project confidentiality while leveraging the power of AI models for concept images. BuiltWorlds NYC Projects conference: New York, May 22-23 In May, Perkins&Will was invited to participate in a panel discussion hosted by BuildWorlds. Charlie Portelli from Perkins&Will was joined by Charlie Miller from Brookfield Properties, Brooke Nicholson from LendLease, Richard Harpham from Skema, and Ilkay Can-Standard from GENx focusing on “Trends in Development Planning, Technology, and AI.”. The conversation touched on various topics, including open-source data, new programmatic requirements for planning, and user experience of spaces. A common thread agreed upon by the panelist was acknowledging how data is becoming a critical part of designing spaces, learning from past projects and being able to forecast the data to future projects. Another thread that emerged revolved around creating the expected experiences that occupants anticipate. With such a rapid change in how occupants interact and use technology on a day-to-day basis, occupants are expecting a similar level of engagement to the build environment. Some conclusions among the panelists are that the architecture profession has been in a constant state of evolution and our roles are constantly evolving. Technology is becoming an integral part of that process. A lot of these changes to our industry can be seen as disruptions if they come from the outside, but if the changes come from within the industry, they would be less disruptive and more evolutionary.",

    "content": "Like all of you, ISO love another good standard to have to get my head round and ISO19650 is one of the new kids on the block. It’s a standard that in the UK has made its way into most of our significant project deliverables, along with proof in working to this standard. So, last year we decided it was time to get certified through an official accredited body in BSI (British Standards Institution). We were successful in our 2023 maiden audit and last week following a really in depth, 2 day, deep dive audit from a particularly meticulous auditor, we can confirm we are certified for a second consecutive year. Yay! This certification offers several advantages : Skipping certain tender response sections. Scoring higher on BIM sections compared to non-accredited competitors. Helping our clients understand the BIM process and the challenges we face leading this process Demonstrating what is required beyond design responsibilities when working to the standard Enables us to continue to pitch and deliver our ISO19650/Digital Twin Enabled added services on projects  (now backed by a certified BSI badge.) Provides the platform and framework for global Perkins&Will ISO19650 accreditation as the standard gains worldwide acceptance. “But we already have our own BIM Standards” Yes we do.. As does everyone else. Rather than individual project, office or company standard, the ISO19650 framework aims to become an industry wide way of working. This is certainly the case with its adoption in the UK. It is worth noting that this has nothing much to do with Revit or clash detection. The successful implementation of ISO19650 hinges on collaboration and collective effort from the entire project team – the client, project managers, designers, constructors (from Tier 1 down to package/trade), cost consultants, key manufacturers/suppliers, and of course asset/facilities managers. Simplified,  the standard is there to benefit everybody and identifies key tasks for all project stakeholders as follows: • The client defines What… is required through design, construction and into operation stages. • The delivery team, led usually by one named organization ( PW at design stages, PW or GC at construction stages) responds with How…. the requirements will be delivered by a collaborative project team. • The delivery team then generates the information via common platforms with approval gates to ensure the delivery of solid information. There is often a strong focus on the continuous use of the information during the operation phase of the asset. ISO19650 clearly identifies new roles and tasks for all stakeholders, justifying the need for additional resources. Historically, leading the BIM process has often fallen to project design leads without extra fees, despite the significant effort required. We tend to first hear of ISO19650/BIM requirements when we are tendering for projects and agreeing contracts but these are usually broad brush meaningless statements (as below). “Produce and operate a BIM ISO19650 Execution Plan. The aspiration is to create a digital twin for future operational management of the demise.” “The project shall achieve BIM Level of Maturity – Level 2 and ISO19650” “The project should be delivered fully in BIM as a coordinated ISO19650 solution” These sentences of “give us some ISO19650” are pretty meaningless. To understand the project aspirations, ISO19650 requests clearly defined client BIM requirements. This is often a bit of a shock to our (financial, healthcare, commercial etc) clients who, not surprisingly, find these difficult to provide in an ISO19650 context.  Perkins&Will to rescue. Our certification reassures clients that we are proficient in leading this process but as requirements are typically not clear, we will present options and associated costs should we be successful through the tender process. We can provide the critical added service role of Client Project Information Manager ensuring 5 key steps are met. This not only ensures the information delivered is consistent and checked at each project milestone but also gives us the opportunity, at a very early stage, to understand what data is important to our clients at handover. This has proved successful with a number of our clients to date DAR Group Jane Street Netflix KPMG Unilever JLL National Health Service Certification options vary depending on project roles, with different levels of audits. There are certifications for both leading the delivery team and also a certification being a member of the delivery team that is being led by another party.  Auditors review relevant ISO19650 clauses and ask for project evidence from tender response to project closeout.  Depth of audit can depend heavily on each auditor’s rigor! Individual certification options are also available, requiring training and exams on key parts of the ISO19650 series. Kudos to Zuzanna Czapla from our Copenhagen office, who recently achieved certification, reflecting our commitment to the standard globally. Copenhagen have also been working to the ISO19650 standard as a member of the delivery team. Final Thoughts The ISO 19650 standard was developed from a number of standards created to support the adoption of BIM Level 2 (mandated by the UK Government in 2016.) Initially, I viewed it as a mere tick box formality, but now recognize its role in bridging the gap between design teams and BIM experts (and their confusing BIM acronym language!)  We are also able to educate our clients, project managers and designers in this space showing how important it is to deliver really solid, high quality information.  While this was always the intention of BIM a key flaw was never creating identifiable roles and fees outside of standard design scopes meaning BIM delivery was usually left solely to Architects on ever decreasing timeline and budgets. Do you need it? Perhaps.  To get certification as an entity you MUST be able to demonstrate proof of working to the ISO19650 standard on projects.  If your studio is doing this then go for it!  If ISO19650 is starting to crop up in your pursuit and bid documents its probably on its way so I’d recommend your studio identifies a Digital Practice or Technical Delivery person to start looking into it. Either way, if our last audit is anything to go by BE PREPARED or PREPARE TO FAIL!",

    "content": "‘Collaborating in the Age of AI’ at AIA Santa Barbara Luc Deckinga spoke on the subject of ‘Collaborating in the Age of AI’ at the AIA Santa Barbara general meeting on April 4th. The event took place at the SOhO restaurant and music club in downtown Santa Barbara and was well attended by the local architecture community who enjoyed dinner during the presentation. The presentation began by looking at how our definition of Artificial Intelligence has changed over the years followed by an overview of the current set of generative AI tools that are available for anyone to use. An analysis of how to apply large language models (LLMs) to architecture and design challenges led to a discussion of the State Street redevelopment project, a prominent effort on the mind of the Santa Barbara community. Luc worked with DMHA Architects and Interior Design, a local firm working on the State Street project, to generate conceptual imagery using Stable Diffusion. The image on the left is a simple building massing photoshopped into a google maps screenshot of a project location along State Street. The four images on the right were created by combining the input image with a text prompt in a ComfyUI workflow using Stable Diffusion, a generative image system.",

    "content": "What’s changing In order to reduce frustration and prevent easily avoidable costly loss of work, you will no longer see any recent files on the Revit home screen in Revit 2022, 2023 and newer versions as they are released. Why this change There are a number of ways to lose work in Revit. One of the most common ways we’ve seen over the past few years, has been opening a model from the Recent Files tab on the Revit home screen and then beginning to work for a few hours only find out that you cannot sync to central and the last few hours of work is lost. But why does this actually happen? When we open a model from the recent files tab in Revit, it does not pull a fresh file from the cloud central model on Bim360. Instead, it simply opens the last local file from your computer which may be days, weeks, or even months old, and it does not check in with the central while opening, it just simply opens that last local copy from your computer. Now if you know this your first action would be to sync to central upon opening one of these recent files and all would be well. But that is not the case in most of the instances of lost work. And sadly, this is becoming an increasingly more common occurrence. So, in an effort to simplify your options of opening a model, prevent frustration, and ultimately prevent costly loss of work, the Digital Practice team has decided that it is better to disable the recent files tab on the Revit home screen and encourage the few extra click to navigate to your model through the correct Autodesk Docs tab right below the Recent Files tab where you can safely and confidently open a fresh copy of your model from the central and will insure less frustration and reduce costly loss of your work. When will this change Look out for this change to your Revit 2022 and Revit 2023 home screens (and newer versions as they are rolled out) over the next few weeks starting April 8th.

Below are just some highlights. Highlights of improvements Technical Design leaders have reviewed all sheets included in the template. The template contains a lot of discreet guidance , which can be turned on and off. QA/QC sheets help the team to keep the file clean and organized, and check their work Color and patterns were used to make graphics more readable. The combination of color and patterns keeps the drawing readable for color-impaired people, especially when printed at greyscale. Last, but not least, the team reviwed and streamlined two important workflows. Documentation of finishes Code Compliance documentation Why we rebuild Periodic rebuilding of Revit templates is necessary because every few years, Revit gains additional functionality we can take advantage of, and also, after several upgrades, the template can accumulate glitches. Even more importantly, we embed new optimized workflows, review/modify standard sheets, and introduce the most efficient documentation methods as a firmwide standard. The Digital Practice team worked with Technical Directors to make it the best P&W Revit template to date! Next steps The US-based Digital Practice and technical design studio leaders have extensively reviewed the new template and provided feedback, which has already been implemented. Look for the roll-out in your studio and provide additional feedback that can be implemented in your project. The new US template will be released today, April 2. Then the studio DAs in collaboration with studio TDC will add local flavor (codes, details, etc.) and publish studio templates. The firmwide training session is scheduled for April 19. In the next few weeks, we will be publishing new mK cards, working on Quickstart, and refining other supporting documentation.

    "content": "AEC Hackathon @ BLOXHUB 2024 LIM Over this past weekend our team participated in an AEC Hackathon hosted by BLOXHUB in Copenhagen. We worked with a pretty diverse crowd to come up with the best overall project that weekend! Check out what we came up with (starts at 33:20): ✨🌱 Planning for biodiverse urban landscape ✨🌱 Cities worldwide face a significant challenge: integrating biodiversity into urban design in a consistent and measurable way. The struggle to balance aesthetic urban spaces with ecosystems that support a diverse range of life forms is real and pressing. 🏙️➡️🌿 The Challenge: This problem has several layers from ecology, to civic, planning and all the way up to politics. The difficulty in planning lies in measuring and implementing biodiversity throughout the design process. Traditional approaches often overlook the critical role that wildlife, species diversity, and vegetation play in creating sustainable urban environments. ✨🌱 Landscape Information Modelling (LIM) ✨🌱 LIM, was awarded the best overall project at AEC Hackathon at BLOXHUB! LIM is designed to enhance how urban spaces are planned and developed, ensuring biodiversity is a core consideration from the outset. Key Features: 🛠️ Design Tool Integration: Seamlessly attaches to Rhino and Revit, bringing biodiversity data right into the heart of the urban design process. 📚 Database Connectivity: Provides access to an extensive data sources like Map of Life species and biodiversity information, enabling informed design decisions. 🌳 Carbon Absorption Analysis: Offers detailed measurements of carbon absorption by medium and large trees, displayed through an easy-to-understand dashboard. 🐾 Species Diversity and Distribution Assessment: Ensures a balanced ecosystem by analyzing the variety and distribution of species across a site. 🗺️ Urban Site Data Integration: Utilizes data sources like Cetopo to inform designers about existing species on site, advocating for their preservation over replacement. 🌐 Why This Matters: LIM embodies our commitment to reimagining urban spaces that not only meet human needs but also enhance the natural environment. By embedding comprehensive biodiversity metrics into the planning process, LIM paves the way for cities that are sustainable, vibrant, and life-supporting. We couldn’t have done this without the dedication and expertise of our team Daniel Boba Ellen Berglund Zuzzana Czpla Mateusz Binkowski Arvis Brunavs Oswaldo Hernandez Victor Wanderley Barbosa (all above from SHL) Riccardo Piazzai (NORDFY) Michal Stysz (COBOD) Andy Andor (SWECO) and together we turned this 2-day hackathon into loads of learning and collaboration at BLOXHUB .

In a departure from previous years, we are opting to skip the Revit 2024 version due to an unresolved error within the Revit 2024 code. Should this error occur, drawing elements may vanish without alerting the user. Such incidents pose a serious risk to the integrity of our work. Firm Directive: Do Not Use Revit 2024 You may encounter situations where collaborating firms propose using Revit 2024. It is imperative that you do not consent to this. The error behaves contagiously and is particularly hazardous in collaborative environments; prevention is impossible. This measure is critical to ensure that our drawings maintain the highest standard of care. We are collaborating with other leading firms and Autodesk to resolve this issue in upcoming releases. If you have any questions, be sure to get in touch with Nick Cameron or your Digital Practice leader immediately. Positive Outlook Fortunately, we identified this issue early, thereby preventing any upgrades of live projects from being affected. This proactive decision ensures that our projects remain free from the risk of data loss. Furthermore, the latest improvements developed in the 2024 template will be added to a new 2023 template. This means all your ongoing and upcoming projects will be able to leverage these enhancements. Keep an eye out for updates on the Digital Practice training program, as it will provide you with a preview of the new features and efficiencies available in the updated Revit template.",

Following the motto “strength through geometry” and the principles of traditional unreinforced masonry construction, this talk will show how translating the (lost) knowledge of the Gothic master builders into today’s praxis results in truly sustainable, circular and economical structures, addressing climate change by significantly reducing embodied emissions, utilizing fewer single-use resources and minimizing construction waste. We will follow our Keynote with a Panel discussion on our decarbonization efforts at Perkins&Will and a Workshop on the tools at our disposal. The week will then continue with a few returning classes on updates to HUB, the best practices surrounding SharePoint, and Emerging Digital Tools.  We will have new sessions on Large Project Strategy and Management, Video Editing, BIM Management and Collaboration, and the new PW Revit Template. We will also be hosting our first semiannual Innovation Incubator Spotlight session, highlighting two of our recently completed Spring Innovation Incubators. The invites for the Digital Practice Core eXchange will be trickling in over the next few days, so stay tuned!",

    "content": "We’ve been hard at work improving Area Sync. Since our last update, we’ve added several asked-for features and eliminated some bugs that should hopefully make your use of Area Sync even smoother. Better overall support for Multi-models We have added features all over the app to support the cases where a team is working on several files, or even several apps like Revit and Rhino at the same time. On the web, is possible now to display multiple syncs using Diagrammr . On Revit, you’ll see what model is active if you have several files opened. Syncing from Rhino is now more flexible since you are able to select to which model to sync to. On the visualization tab on the web is now possible to overlay multiple models (or syncs together). Metrics Until now, on the main Area Sync tab you would see a total area representing all rooms from the latest sync or the current Revit model. Area Sync now is capable of filtering, trimming and narrowing down these total by using what we call a Metric. Metrics help teams keep an eye on what’s relevant at a given time, or for a particular stakeholder. This feature is still in beta and will likely change a little before reach stability. Please tell us what you think! Excel workflows imports/exports The visualization tab (also known as Diagrammr ) now offer way more options for importing and exporting your data from Area Sync or even from/to Revit and Excel. Handling bulk edits on spreadsheet applications like Excel is way easier and some project managers take it even further to develop analysis on top of this data. Assets tracking PowerBI dashboards We have started developing dashboards combining Speckle and Area Sync to track assets and furnitures inside Revit/Rhino models. You can download our current version of this dashboard from [INSERT-LINK-HERE]. New features: Included support for Revit 2024 Pie chart visualization on Diagrammr Filtering capabilities on Diagrammr Export to PowerBi from Diagrammr Import rooms and areas from Excel Multi-model/sync visualization on Diagrammr Auto populate column with AI (Beta) Sort model by Column Default color scheme Metrics (Beta) Display current active model in Revit Fixes: Ignored rooms without levels during sync. Find and replace issues Color palettes from Revit Incorrectly sync model naming We’re excited for the coming year and for all of the new features we’re planning on adding to Area Sync!",

    "content": "SpeckleCon 2023 SpeckleCon is an online conference that gathered over 1,500 people to engage, discuss, and collaborate on topics that matter to us in the AEC technology space. Centering around the utilization of Speckle . Over two days, we had the chance to hear from fellow colleagues and experts who shared specific use cases and demoed how Speckle enabled them to unlock and own their data to deliver projects faster and more efficiently. We closed our first day with a Panel Conversation inviting experts from DAR, Jacobs, HENN, and Speckle to discuss data strategies in AEC. On Dev Day, Speckle announced a new service called Automate, an iterative tool designed for developers, engineers, and architects. It allows workflows to run automatically after every model change in Speckle, removing the need for manual intervention. This announcement included demos and interactions with the tool, showcasing its value for the AEC industry. Also during dev day, Victor and Daniel from Schmidt Hammer Lassen / Perkins&Will hosted a one-hour live coding session building and app from scratch on top of Speckle, the app is a catalogue for furniture used inside Revit/Rhino models. The whole conference is available online at SpeckleCon: It’s A Wrap!",

Speaking of bugs, we’d like to thank all of you using the Feedback button to provide those valuable bug reports and feature requests. On to the update! Benefits We added the Benefits app back in October to assist our US-based studios during their Open Enrollment period. Thrive For this year, we rolled all of the constituent parts of Thrive into a single, unified app to help you get more from your Thrive reviews. Job Descriptions We’ve also added a new job descriptions app to better clarify what it is we all do and help us all get a baseline understanding of each others skills, experiences, and responsibilities. Clients & Consultants The Organization app has been renamed to Clients & Consultants . It’s still keeping the functionality of the Org app while allowing us to add dashboard capabilities for clients and eventually consultants in order to better align with our client executive program and the CRM tools they may need. Firmwide Calendar We added the capability of displaying a studio calendar. Studio’s will need to request that this be enabled for your people. Once enabled, it can be used to manage local events and happenings in your studios! Project App We’ve made the DEAR submission and management process easier within the Project app by adding a wizard as well as consolidating it all into a submissions page. We’ve also added an Export to CSV button in the staffing section (under PMTK)! Lastly, in October in preparation for the RAMP committee review we made a number of small changes in the RAMP page. Now you can see risk management notes and actions. Innovation Apps The Innovation Library received a bit of a visual touchup. We also went back and consolidated all previous data that had been on soon-to-be-retired knowledge repositories into the library app. We also launched Innovation Submissions to streamline the Innovation Incubator submission and review process. Design Management The Project apps design-focused counterpart. Storyboard, Living Design, and Design Review can all be found here and is intended to act as a quick studio overview dashboard for design directors and leaders. Strategic Action Plan The SAP app has been updated for this year and should reflect all studio’s latest strategic action plans.   We have revised per our nine-dimension grid of focus areas as well as summarized all the studio’s action plans using AI. Client-Facing Design Guidelines Recently, we built out a forward-facing app for one of our corporate clients to act as their global design standards playbook. Rather than relying on previous static processes to design and deliver the guidebook we created a flexible, smart, and easy to use site that’s easy to navigate and can be data-driven. We agreed to host this playbook for the next 5 years and they can continue contributing to it. We can now use this frame to deliver similar services to the rest of our clients! Plus Survey Finally, quick reminder that the Plus Survey app can be found on Hub.",

    "content": "The problem Naming things is Boring. How many times you name something on a building? Think of a room and how stakeholders could name the same room: John Kennedy Conference Room (Client) Conference Room 101 (20p) (Architect) Conference (Energy Engineer) Office (Structural Engineer) C-NYC.101 (Facilities Management) The process of labelling all this is tedious and prone to mistakes. By practicing in an increasingly world of standards, classification systems and regulations to comply, we saw an opportunity that could help various stakeholders of the AEC industry. Boring – AI real-time naming and classification Boring is an innovative AI-powered application designed to revolutionize how we understand and process textual data. Utilizing advanced Sentence Transformers (sorry, not the usual Midjourney/GPT tech, but still extremely useful) this application excels in identifying text similarities and classifying words with remarkable precision. It delves deep into the nuances of language (mispelling, different language, etc), enabling users to uncover hidden connections between different texts and to categorize words based on context with a high degree of confidence. Whether it’s for environmental analysis, structural engineering, life cycle assessments, or cost estimations, Boring offers a powerful tool for anyone looking to extract deeper meaning and insights from textual data. The app was designed to be available for users in Revit, Rhino, Pollination, Web and so on. We looked at this solution at the CORE studio at Thornton Tomasetti # AECtech hackathon, and got an honorable mention 🏆 among the other very interesting proposals. The team was composed by Nick Cameron, Jason Diammond, Ellen Berglund, Daniel Boba and me from Perkins&Will, we teamed up with Mostapha from LadybugTools/Pollination and Alexander Matthias from BIG. The hackathon application has been open sourced and some of the participants are still contributing to this project. Maybe you can join it as well! Github: https://lnkd.in/efJdGij3 “Working” on hackathons Participating in hackathons is a thrilling and educational experience, blending creativity, technical skills, and teamwork. These events, typically lasting from 24 to 48 hours, require participants to quickly identify a problem and devise a solution. The first step is usually pinpointing a relevant problem that is both challenging and achievable within the given timeframe. Forming a balanced team comes next; it should comprise individuals with diverse skills, including coding, design, project management, and domain-specific knowledge. This diversity ensures a holistic approach to problem-solving. It also makes the process much more fun, when a team is diverse in skills and expertise, each member brings a unique set of abilities to the table, reducing the likelihood of anyone feeling left out or idle. Effective time management is vital, as is maintaining a balance between ambition and practicality in the proposed solution. Regular communication within the team and with mentors, if available, helps refine ideas and overcome technical hurdles. The intense, collaborative nature of hackathons not only fosters innovation but also offers a unique learning environment, where participants can expand their skills and network with like-minded individuals. There are several of other hackathons hosted around the world, both focused on the AEC but also other industries. I hope you consider joining one of them sooner rather than later. In Copenhagen we usually join the AEC Hackathon BLOXHUB event that happens on Spring. See you there!",

    "content": "David Sewell and I had given a class on Autodesk University about working on the projects towards  ISO 19650, mainly sharing our personal, practical experience but also explaining fundamentals about the standard. Our London office has been pioneering project leadership in adherence to ISO 19650 since 2016. This international standard holds the key to fostering commonality in work practices, streamlined delivery teams, and interconnected datasets. However, as promising as it sounds, ISO 19650 has often been accompanied by challenges such as a new language, complex standards, and the emergence of siloed BIM experts. The class aimed to bridge the gap, ensuring that professionals across diverse locations could grasp the essence of ISO 19650 and apply it strategically rather than adhering to a rigid, one-size-fits-all approach. A key takeaway from the class was the emphasis on aligning with a strategic and pragmatic approach, as opposed to a mandatory verbatim implementation. We highlighted real-world examples, offering a nuanced understanding of how ISO 19650 can be integrated seamlessly, from different roles perspective, without the need for excessive additional hours. What is ISO 19650? The ISO 19650 standard is a framework, set by the International Organization of Standardization, to outline the recommended processes for managing information about buildings and assets, throughout the asset lifecycle. The successful implementation of ISO 19650 hinges on collaboration among project stakeholders. This collective effort encompasses the entire project team – the client, project managers, designers, constructors (from Tier 1 down to package/trade), cost consultants, key manufacturers/suppliers, and of course asset/facilities managers. Effective teamwork demands a structured and open collaboration. The ISO 19650 standard is a key player in this landscape, aiming to ensure that the right information reaches the right people at the right time for informed decision-making. It promotes a consistent approach across all project stages, streamlining the delivery of handover information in a standardized format for use in other business platforms and applications. While the many pages of the standard can seem confusing initially, the premise of the standard is there to benefit everybody and identifies key tasks for all project stakeholders. In super simplified terms:  The client defines What … is required through design, construction and into operation stages.  The delivery team, led usually by one named organization depending on project stage, responds with How …. the requirements will be delivered by a collaborative project team.  The delivery team then generates the information via common platforms with approval gates to ensure the delivery of solid information. There is often a strong focus on the continuous operation and maintenance of the asset. Working this way means that requirements are clear from project outset and better, fit for purpose information is produced progressively by the appropriate party. An audit trail can be captured showing when decisions were made, by who and at what time during the project delivery process. This all means better collaboration and coordination along with consistent outputs being delivered at handover ready for reuse in operation. Watch the full class here: If you would like to know more about the standard here is the link for really useful guidelines.",

However, there is a deep social impact of feeding into the culture of consumerism and disposability as well as raising questions of authenticity. However, fast design with AI can generate an echo-chamber effect without the right guidance of prompts. This is how biases and stereotypes are perpetuated through a spiral of validating results by generating similar outcomes that continue to add to the statistical data. Developing a process and having an understanding the prompt composition is part of how to find your personal AI voice. It is in the personalization of the process that keeps the human at the center of the design story. There is a high responsibility to write our digital heritage with a rich blend of voices from our diverse collective.

Every year, ACADIA organizes an international conference to share the most recent research peer-reviewed articles and experimental projects. This year the 2023 ACADIA conference was held in person at the University of Colorado Denver College of Architecture and Planning in Denver, October 26-28, sponsored by Perkins&Will. The 2023 Call, Habits of the Anthropocene, was an invitation to migrate from a Building-Centric to a Human-Centric perspective, examining suppressed voices, indigenous and feminist thinking, unconventional theories, and new trends in technology. The three-day event, preceded by a week of online workshops, was structured around three main tracks: Biomaterials, production processes, and the impact of AI in design. The first day explored how to harvest, grow, and apply all kinds of new biomaterials in design, The second day investigated production approaches ranging from controlled growing techniques to printing and assembling methods. The final day was divided between human-centric topics and AI applications in Architecture. Perkins&Will Design Process Lab presented the article “A general-purpose deep-learning surrogate model for annual daylight distribution” by Spyridon Ampanavos, Marcelo Bernal, and Victor Okhoya. This research is intended to accelerate the time-consuming daylight simulations and facilitate easy access to designers by implementing predictive models while preserving the accuracy of the results",

    "content": "Computational Design Working Group: Designing with Physics! The Bi-Weekly Computational Design Working Group has been meeting in the Teams/DigitalPractice/Computational Design channel for the past several months. We’d like to thank everyone who has attended and reinvite anyone who hasn’t attended. No prior experience necessary! Anyone interested in advanced design workflows is encouraged to join us. The agenda is available here (and also in a tab at the top of the Teams channel). Feel free to add a discussion topic and put your name next to it so we can discuss it up on the next call. Undulating Glass Courtyard Roof Here is one example of a design exercise that was discussed on a recent call. The design challenge was to enclose an interior courtyard with an undulating glazed diagrid roof structure, similar to the inspirational examples of the Smithsonian Kogol courtyard and King’s Cross station roof shown here. For more information about this computational workflow reach out to Luc Deckinga. For information about the overall project reach out to Dan McTavish and Ugonna Ohakim. Smithsonian Kogol Courtyard King’s Cross Station Rhino & Grasshopper Rhino was chosen as the design platform because of its ability to create smooth, flexible geometry that can be easily modified. Grasshopper, a visual scripting platform integrated into Rhino, provides an even faster way to investigate design options. Key parameters, like the number of surface subdivisions, can be linked to sliders in Grasshopper to quickly achieve the desired surface resolution. Sliders in Grasshopper control the number of points in each direction. Kangaroo Physics The design team investigated several different ways to translate the design surface into a diagrid, eventually deciding on a form-finding method that relies upon Kangaroo, a Grasshopper plugin that enables you to apply real-world physics forces to your geometry. Kangaroo can convert a surface into a grid of points, connected to one another by springs. This effectively turns the surface into a piece of fabric that can be draped, pinned, stretched, and deformed based on the forces that you apply to it. In the example below the perimeter points have been ‘anchored’ in place so they do not move. All points are connected to one another with lines that try to maintain the same length. This turns the surface into a spring network. Finally, a uniform ‘up’ force is applied to all the points, stretching the springs, eventually arriving at a catenary surface that is fit to the courtyard. The physics simulation runs, slowly stretching the spring network over time. It will eventually stop moving when all forces are resolved and the network comes to rest in a catenary shape. Solid Body Collisions There are many different forces within the Kangaroo library. For additional control over the diagrid shape the design team used a technique called solid body collision, which forces the points in the spring network to stay outside of another object in the scene. In the example below there are two spheres being used as the solid bodies. You must start with the bodies away from the points and slowly push the solid bodies towards the points. If you start with the points inside the bodies they don’t know which way is ‘out’ and so they don’t know which direction to move. Before After The Before image shows the solid bodies and deformed surface. The After image shows the final diagrid form. Stay Tuned… This project is still in the early stages so it will change and develop over time. Join us on the bi-weekly computational design call to stay up to date on this, and many other interesting projects and workflows being executed throughout the firm. See you at our next meeting on October 10 in the Digital Practice/Computational Design teams channel !",

On Hold Status has been updated in the app with a better UI to reflect confirmation and updates to hold dates. Showing design and construction start and end dates from the schedule info on the Info Center page. Small updates to include more data about 3rd party certifications and Media Hits which can be found under the marketing section of the app. Started to tag DEAR Stage 1 projects per the Design Leadership Council based on general thresholds of size and project stage of all projects firmwide. Requesting a new project phase in Deltek right from creating a new phase for your project in Hub. Added K-12 specific project keyword tags to go along with the other market sectors we have keywords for. We have introduced a new Social Purpose app .   This app pulls in projects from PMTK that are defined as a program type of Social Purpose.  This is to showcase the work the firm does for those who need design services that don’t have the budget.  We also have an area to plan and track all volunteer events that your Service + group may be planning and engaging in at the local studio level.  We also highlight studio leaders who help organize and maintain the culture Social Purpose provides in our firm. We have introduced a Year End Planning Calendar app (limited access) which is simply to communicate the events and steps for all the efforts around wrapping up the current year and planning for the next.   This includes leadership meetings, business planning, US Open Enrollment, DEAR, Technical Design Reviews, PLUS for clients and teams, Thrive, MOD Reviews, Leadership program, and Incentive Compensation Program. The Project Delivery Manual app is coming soon as we lift it up off of Pulse and shift it over to Hub in an effort to decommission Pulse by the end of this year. The Contracts app (limited access) is being introduced as a place to track what projects have client and consultant contracts uploaded.  It also gives a single interface to manage all project contracts for your studio if you have a point person or team that works with those files. A reminder that there is a Studio calendar option within the Firmwide calendar app.   Many studios have set this up as a way to have a single point of all the studio events going on.   If you don’t see this option for yourself in the Firmwide Calendar app, please coordinate with your studio management to see if this would be a good solution to set up for your own studio to help communicate the culture of what is happening around here.",

    "content": "Hands-On Fabrication Workshop at Zahner Headquarters in Kansas City August 16-18 Designers from several Perkins&Will studios gathered in Zahner’s Kansas City headquarters for a 3-day workshop August 15th to 18th. The goal of the workshop was to introduce our designers to advanced metal manipulation techniques that you can achieve working with a sophisticated partner like Zahner. Experimentation was focused on digital-direct-to-fabrication methods that Zahner uses on their ImageLines , ImageWall , and PrecisionPatina to perforate, deform, and pattern their metal surfaces. (Online tools are available for you to play around with each of those. Try the links!) Each design team started by designing a 2’x2′ panel to become familiar with the various surfacing techniques and then scaled up to a 5’x10′ zone on a mock-up tower that Zahner prepared to install the final results of the workshop. Check out some photos from our time there and stay tuned for presentations from our designers, or reach out to them directly and ask about their experience in Kansas City. We would like to make this a recurring workshop, so if you would like to attend a future iteration let us know! Check out this video that Zahner produced of our time there! If you’d like to learn more about the Perkins&Will partnership with Zahner or to contact Zahner in regards to a project you are working on, reach out to the workshop organizers and they can get you in touch with the right people. Attendees: Mahdiar Ghaffarian, Charlie Portelli, Thiago Silvino, Nick Cameron, Stefan Burnett, Ron Stelmarski, Mark Walsh, Wyatt Beard, Thomas Mozina, David D’Andrea, Andrew Frontini Organizers: Mario Romero and Luc Deckinga along with Burcin Nalinci, and Nathan Barnes of ZahnerLabs Scroll to the bottom to load image gallery…",

    "content": "PMTK: New Features 2Q We are excited to be adding some more new functionality to the PMTK.  We have been doing many small requests and minor improvements from your feedback along the way since the initial rollout in March.  This update introduces several new features all of which were suggestions by all of you through the feedback button or in prior meetings.  Thank you everyone for keeping the conversation going and letting us know how we can keep making this tool better. The following is a list of the significant improvements that have been added to the toolkit last week. Details by Phase This feature introduces a new page under the PMTK portion of the navigation that brings together items from the schedule, budget, and staffing pages filter phase by phase.  You can choose to switch and look at whatever phase you want to in this focused view.  This also makes progress metrics more prominent to understand where you are at in any given phase. Snapshot Staffing We have added to the snapshot function on the budget page the feature to save multiple versions of your staffing plan.   You can use this what-if scenario building to create multiple labor plans that test options you are considering before adjusting your working plan budget and staffing. Bill Rate Costing This feature is found in the actions drop-down of the staffing page and has a function to change the visibility of the related rows on the budget page.  Now you can model your labor costs based on bill rates in addition to cost rates which you have control over to adjust the bill rates to reflect your specific contract on your project. Add Services Table This new feature can be found under the actions drop-down on the top right of the Budget page.  This was modeled after the countless Excel table examples many of you shared with us to track add services with the breakdown of fees between our firm and our consultants.  This will allow you to track the progress of a proposed add service as you draft it and seek client approval. Inflation Factor The details of this can be found in the actions drop-down on the Budget page.  We are now building in standard factors to account for the yearly raises at the firm that increase our own labor and overhead costs into the future.  This will be added to our ETC numbers and will be opt-in for active projects and default for new projects. Consultant Management Fee/Markup This new feature can be found under the actions drop-down on the top right of the Budget page.  It allows you to add a markup fee that will be added to the contract total based on a percentage of your reimbursable consultant feeds. There are several other small improvements like milestone imports and templates on the schedule page.   The ability to request a new Deltek phase directly from the schedule view after you make a phase later in the project after the initial setup.   Others have been introduced over the last couple of months and more are to come in the coming weeks and months. We will continue to have training series happening to cover these items.  Please watch for invites on the PWU channel. As always keep using the feedback tool to share your ideas and report bugs.   We have also introduced a PMTK Teams channel under the Digital Practice Microsoft Team if you want to connect directly to someone to ask any how-to questions.",

All US content is published in the PW Imperial 2022 channel, and each international office maintains their own channel. Digital Practice created the QuickStart Guide and conducted series of trainings. Feedback has been very positive. Users noted significant improvement in responsiveness, adaptive search using dynamic filters, and in general better “Findability” of the content. User’s favorite features are Hi-Rez preview of sheets and details, packages, ability to share a link to an object with your collegue, and tips for finding relevant Autodesk out of the box content. This was a first step of the migration , we are already working to refine previews where needed, and to create additional packages based on your requests and feedback. This refinement process will continue. Do not be shy! Help us to make our content better. Please let us know if you find any issues with objects by flagging them and commenting. If you want to add/publish additional content, please talk with your local DA. If you need a  package spanning multiple offices, let Helen Gorina know. AVAIL is content agnostic, and is not limited by one application . Revit content migration was just the first phase. We are exploring workflows for other types of objects and other applications, and will update you as new channels will be published.",

    "content": "Artifact User Interface Updates & Project Viewer Artifact helps designers find existing drawings that solve current design challenges. To accomplish this the Artifact interface was designed to search, filter, save, and share the drawings that have been added to the database. Aiprentice, the developer of Artifact, has just released a new, cleaner search UI that incorporates your feedback over the past several years. Another thing we have discovered as more of you use Artifact, is that many of you want to view an entire drawing set at once, similar to flipping through a PDF. To accomplish this we’ve created a Project Viewer . Click on the project name or sheet number in the right-hand info sidebar of any view in Artifact (see image below). Check out the recent Core eXchange presentation for more info on the UI changes and Project Viewer. Navigation has been consolidated to a sidebar on the left. All the actions available in the drawing sidebar, including links to the new Project Viewer interface. What is Artifact? How do I log in? Artifact is the Revit drawing search website that turns your text notes and metadata into search terms, so you find exactly the drawing you’re looking for and adapt it to a new project. Artifact is a collaboration between AIPrentice, a software developer, and Perkins&Will’s Digital Practice department.  To log in automatically with your Perkins&Will credentials, go to Pwitter (green arrow) > Microsoft MyApps > Artifact. Add Your Work to Artifact Artifact is only as good as the content within, so we are asking you to contribute your studio’s work. Please talk to the technical and design leadership within your studio to identify projects to include, and coordinate with your Digital Practice representative, or Digital Practice Manager Luc Deckinga, to add your content. As of this article, we have 106,248 drawings in the Artifact database, taken from 161 completed projects designed by twenty different Perkins&Will studios. Let’s see how long it takes us to get to 200,000! Thanks for all your help and support! We will continue to improve Artifact and add new features. Stay tuned.",

    "content": "On the 20th and 21st of June some of our European teammates gathered in London to attend the NXT BLD and NXT DEV conferences. NXT BLD is known for being an event which explores emerging technologies for the built environment, beyond BIM. The talks and panels were recorded and made available on the conference website: NXT BLD: https://nxtbld.com/live-stream-2023-register/ NXT DEV: https://nxtdev.build/view-on-demand/ Here’s some of the most interesting talks: NXT BLD Part: 3 Assemble This talk continues from two previous parts given in the previous conference years. Greg Schleusner from HOK advocates for an Entity Component System pattern for AEC to share data between various software applications. This pattern is the standard for the Gaming industry and the talk goes through how this could also be applied in our industry. One for the key elements highlighted is the use of USD, the data schema developed by Pixar and still most popular on the filming and gaming industry to transfer data. Towards Sustainable Design Technologies Michael exposes how the design technology team at **Herzog & De Meuron** operates and exposes some of the design tooling developed in-house to assist designers in various tasks in both Rhino and Revit world. They are approaching BIM standards by using configuration files to quickly generate BIM templates that can adapt to different locations and regulations. This could potentially be a game changer for BIM implementation in the industry. Michael talks about different approaches to BIM depending on the project stage or client requirements. They work within three categories: **BIM Light, BIM Standard and BIM Maximum**. BIM Light usually happens early stage during design concept, while BIM Standard falls into normal BIM practice and BIM Maximum defines customized workflows and advanced data modelling. The talk also gives an overview on how this processes evolved during a decade. Cloaked in Bureaucracy: The Emperor’s New Clothes in the World of BIM? This presentation reveals the consequences of excessive bureaucracy on BIM projects. Jens from BIG shed light on the paradoxical situation where BIM, intended to enhance efficiency, can paradoxically lead to delays, cost overruns, and frustration. By examining real-world case studies, Jens will expose some of the underlying causes and manifestations of bureaucratic bottlenecks that impede the realization of BIM’s transformative power. This is a must watch for people reviewing BIM contractual requirements. NXT DEV Future Design Software “Shopping List” This talk and panel goes over an engagement of large architectural firms in the UK to develop a specification for design software based on current needs. It goes into details specifying a data framework, sustainability goals, computation, deliverables generation and commercial aspects. It is a good package of problems faced in practice that could be addressed by software companies. Panel: The Future of AI in AEC Probably the most talked topic in the industry at the moment. The panel highlighted how problematic and complex issues like ethics, trust and security are on a different level and should be addressed not by architects but by long experienced AI academics. This seemed like a bucket of “cold water” for some attendants in the crowd, but in my opinion an extremely angle on of this topic. Another point was made about how the AEC lacked the capacity to have its own data stored and how this could be an opportunity for current practices. We have been witnessing mind blowing AI models perform tasks which were only possible given training data available on the web (images, text, etc).",

    "content": "In our previous blog post, titled “Trust but Verify,” we emphasized the importance of verification when working with generative AI tools. Today, we will delve deeper into how Perkins&Will is actively exploring the use of generative AI throughout the firm and how we can facilitate the sharing and learning process in this rapidly evolving technology landscape. Additionally, we will introduce the Perkins&Will guidelines for using generative AI. At Perkins&Will, various groups including the Project Delivery, Research, & Technology Boards and Human Resources are fully engaged in prioritizing a comprehensive understanding of generative AI’s potential and its impact on our firm and industry. Furthermore, studios like Boston and Vancouver have been hosting internal discussions, exchanging insights, and collaborating to explore the possibilities of generative AI. We extend an invitation to join and contribute to the broader conversation happening within our studios and across other teams in the firm. By gathering diverse perspectives, we enable a critical evaluation of generative AI’s capabilities. To promote wider engagement and ongoing conversations, we have established a new AI channel in the Digital Practice Teams space, click here to join in . This channel serves as an open platform for everyone to participate, contribute ideas, and share knowledge. By opening up the conversation, we tap into the collective intelligence and expertise of our firm, expanding our understanding of what may be possible while also being mindful of potential pitfalls. Looking ahead, our upcoming Core Exchange in July (email invites to follow) will feature a keynote address by an external AI expert. We also have plans to organize panels that will discuss the current state of AI within our firm and explore the future possibilities in our industry. These panels foster collaboration within Perkins&Will and encourage dialogue with external experts, ensuring our firm remains at the forefront of technological advancements. Lastly, we are pleased to include a copy of the Perkins&Will guidelines for using generative AI below. These guidelines serve as a reference for employees, contractors, and third parties who use generative AI technology on behalf of our firm. They suggest parameters within which the use of generative AI aligns with our values, legal and ethical standards, and protects the interests of all stakeholders involved. By nurturing collaboration across boards, studios, and through the Digital Practice Teams Channel, Perkins&Will leverages its collective intelligence to ensure the responsible use of generative AI. Together, we will navigate this exciting technological landscape while delivering exceptional solutions to our clients and elevating the AI employee learning experience. Loading... Taking too long?

    "content": "A diverse group of coders and designers from Perkins&Will’s i/o and Digital Practice groups along with our partners at Introba and DAR convened in Chicago on May 22-27. They were joined by the Autodesk Platform Services (formerly Forge) team for a week-long accelerator where the P&W team learned how to use the Autodesk APIs to create their own web applications. Attendees broke into groups focused around a particular API to explore or an app to develop. One group created a method for on-demand PDF creation from Revit models on BIM360 using the Model Derivative API. Their working prototype is now being developed into a fully functional add-in that will be deployed across the entire Perkins&Will BIM360 hub.

    "content": "Technology in the architectural industry is often related to process efficiency. Great, fast is good. But, what amazes me is the bridges that technology can build within a work community, at SHL – Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects and Perkins&Will we are architects, designers, technologists, engineers, advisors, communicators, software developers, and whatnot. We speak English mostly, but the daily duties require these roles to communicate in different ways. Some talk through sketches, others through spreadsheets, and others through plain text or computer code. My goal with this post is to share with you the importance of digitalizing the platform of architecture, and not only design. And how it’s a team game. Just this week we iterated over 4 pieces of technology that our team is shipping/updating. Here’s how they are modernizing the way we address our clients and problems. 1. Area Sync Hospitals, large mix-use buildings, university campuses, and master plans are often projects with a high level of “program” complexity. Taking client briefs with thousands of spaces that need to be built is sometimes overwhelming and a creativity killer within a project. Area Sync streamlines the data from inside our design apps (#Rhino, #Revit) down to the client’s desk where they can make changes and decisions using #PowerBI dashboards filled from our internal #GraphQL API. 2. Sustainability Practice Cards The sustainability process at SHL uses a game of cards to get clients to think more deeply about their goals and intentions on a project. Are they targeting a specific certification? What are the main sustainability concerns? We have processes, questions, and tools. All in a card deck. We have introduced #Airtable to our Sustainability and Business Development teams as a low-code cloud-based solution to manage the data behind this system. 3. Library Cards It’s a spin-off from our practice cards! SHL is known for its work with libraries and soon we will be hosting a workshop as part of the Next Library Librarians conference in Aarhus. We developed a workshop #webapp tool where participants will be able to design their cards to help design the next generation of libraries, using only their phones. Straight back to #Airtable. 4. Snippets Let’s talk about #Grasshopper. That’s where I started my journey with technology and many other architects and engineers as well. The best way to learn is by trying, looking at samples, and getting inspired. #Snippets is a library of computational design workflows that are designed to inspire, teach and grow. It has already +60 scripts and continues to grow. We have recently added new facade scripts and also a bunch of #RhinoInsideRevit helpers. Shoutout to this team of silo breakers: Nick Cameron Zuzanna Czapla Daniel Boba Ellen Berglund Viviana Padron Esaa Enlai Hooi Helena Jingyi Bjørn Christensen Michael Atzen Elif Tinaztepe Sanne Wall-Gremstrup Jens Buch-Dohrmann Ricardo Ruiter Kanamori Oswaldo Hernández Bueno",

    "content": "AreaSync is a tool designed to synchronize the design data between the various tools our planners and designers use to program and design the project. Whether one starts the design as program data inside Excel or creates a model by laying out walls, rooms, and areas inside Revit , AreaSync is there to synchronize the data between Excel and Revit and consolidate the data into a more analytical dashboard using PowerBI. By tracking the rooms and areas of the project, we can easily visualize the progress of the building design and ensure the team has not deviated too far from our original program target size thus minimizing rework and redesign. Let’s start with the program data that the planners have carefully crafted with our client in Excel. Using the AreaSync Excel plugin, the program data in Excel can easily integrate with the design data from Revit. With three simple steps of AreaSync Setup, Download, and Upload to DB. Once the programmed rooms are uploaded into our Cloud database, they are ready to be used by our Designers. After running the AreaSync Setup, the Excel file connects directly to our Cloud Database and allows you to download any drawing data extracted from the Revit model or models of the same project, or to upload programmed room data to the Database. Before uploading the program data, a few quick steps of data cleanup is needed. Luckily, we have figured out the best way of using power query to transform the program from a report summary into an itemized room-by-room list of room data more digestible by the database. Imagine a tool that can automatically bring in all your programmed rooms and their attached room data (room name, number, department, target size, etc.) from Excel and place them inside your Revit model as a room object on the designated floor level in the correct target size. Using AreaSync, a designer can import 3000+ rooms and place them into the Revit model after one or two clicks and a few minutes of waiting while he/she is getting some afternoon tea and biscuits. AreaSync – Import Data is designed to do just that. The AreaSync Revit Plugin’s Import Data Setup allows you to select which parameters you wish to bring in with your room data, and how those parameters will be mapped to which Revit’s Room Parameters. New Rooms can be imported as placed or unplaced rooms. If you want to place the rooms, you can specify the room size (default size vs. custom size using Target Area) and the level (default level vs. custom level using the level parameter), next the rooms can be sorted by department and then by size from large to small. Once the rooms are placed in the model, the designers can drag and move the pre-populated rooms into walled areas they have designed without having to retype anything. Next, change the Color scheme of your floor plan view, and all the rooms are color-coded by the their department or any other property you have pre-filled. Round Trip back to Excel After the rooms are moved and placed into the actual building, the rooms are marked as “ASR_Placed_on_Plan”, and the Revit model is synced to the database. Planners can open Excel and download the latest Revit data, using ASR_ID to synchronize with the latest Rooms from Revit, reflecting the drawn room areas vs. the target area. This bi-directional update process allows both designers and planners to work with the latest and greatest room data in their preferred programs, Excel and Revit, at the same time. While our Dashboard in PowerBI taps into the same data extracted from both programs and presents a consolidated real-time analytical view for the whole team. Now everyone can see the three thousand feet high overview of the project based on realtime data.",

    "content": "Staying up-to-date with the latest technological advancements is crucial for Perkins&Will, especially with the clear emergence of generative AI. The increasing accessibility of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and Dall-E 2 from OpenAI , and the soon-to-be-released Co-Pilot from Microsoft , make it apparent that they have the potential to impact the future of designing and delivering projects for our clients. However, it is important to approach the latest technological trend with caution and remember the old adage, “Trust, but Verify.” The term “hallucination” refers to the phenomenon where generative AI tools produce results that may seem impressive but are not entirely accurate. As a result, we must be vigilant in verifying the accuracy of the AI-generated output. If this is all new to you here is a link to an AI 101 video from the Wall Street Journal. We have also compiled a short list of available tools and ideas shared from across the firm for you to explore and consider how we may begin to work differently. Please feel free to email me or leave your thoughts in the comments. Let’s embrace the potential of generative AI while remaining mindful of its limitations. Let’s challenge ourselves to explore new ways of working and delivering projects, always with a critical eye and a commitment to excellence. And remember by adopting the “Trust, but Verify” mindset, we can navigate this new technological landscape while continuing to innovate and provide amazing solutions to our clients.

    "content": "We rolled out the Project Management Toolkit (PMTK) portion of the project app in the month of March.   This launch replaces our vision resource planning portion of Deltek Vision as the way the firm will staff and budget our projects.   This single source of truth will be the driver for connecting and setting up all our cloud platforms and pulling together all key aspects of delivering projects effectively and successfully.   In addition to a more modern and intuitive interface, we also are intending to deliver insights to project leadership in order to make more informed decisions as well as awareness to the project team as to how they contribute to delivering a successful project both from a design excellence point of view as well as a financially profitable project. We have continued to provide orientation sessions and build more documentation to guide your use of the PMTK in the Project app.   You can find these through the Help buttons on the top right of any page as well as through these links here. https://digitalpractice.perkinswill.com/quickstarts/pmtk-quickstart/ https://digitalpractice.perkinswill.com/docs/project-app/general/ While the Project App is the main interface that project leaders and teams will be interacting with your project data and information there is a host of supporting apps that will also facilitate some of the workflows we have around the firm and within our projects. Client Hub – We have been piloting a client Hub to seamlessly share basic project information around design progress, schedule, meeting minutes, project area, and other key items a client would want to keep track of in a beautiful and easy interface. Studio Staffing – This roll-up of project staffing information gives a single view of where our designer’s assignments are in order to make sure we are not giving too little or too much work to anyone in order to effectively deliver all of our projects on time and on budget. Finance App – This app supports the budget review and approval process the firm has in place for Operations and Finance to do their quality control checks of initial plans and updates created by our Project Managers.   It is also a rollup of key project budget numbers into a single view to allow studio leaders to track which projects are trending in a bad direction in order to give support and guidance to correct the course. Deltek Sync Management – This app supports the project number request and creation process, the phase mapping, project mapping, and vendor mapping between Hub and Deltek to allow Finance to make sure the right numbers are going to the right locations in your project. Timesheet Tracker – This app helps target communications with those of us that are tardy on getting our timesheets done which is the way our projects earn their revenue.   This helps the rest of us not get additional communications when we have been submitting them on time. Time Off – This app logs the approved holiday or annual leave time you have taken so that we can properly staff our projects in your absence.   This info then shows up in our studio staffing app, the calendar view of your projects schedule, and the Firmwide Calendar studio view. My Schedule – You can see your own personal planned schedule for work for the upcoming weeks as a roll-up of all the project staffing assignments and time off you have put into the system. Storyboard and Living Design – These two apps are undergoing some improvements in order to roll into a single view the current project visuals as well as the design excellence framework metrics we are entering into our projects in order to help anyone understand the current status of any project’s design. FIR (First Incident Reports) – This app rolls together all FIRs for our internal legal team that are submitted through the RAMP page of the project app so they can help give you guidance should something occur on your project. RAMP (Risk Assessment Management Program) – This project rolls together all risk metrics that are entered or tracked for firmwide leadership to focus their attention on the projects that need additional support or guidance to successfully deliver their project through higher levels of riskiness. There are many other improvements planned for the Project app and other supporting apps to continue to improve and streamline our existing workflows.   Please continue to use the black Feedback button on the side of any page on Hub to let us know if anything isn’t working or if you have an idea to improve the tools all teams have able to deliver for our clients.",

    "content": "Studio Innovation eXchange In this month’s Studio Innovation eXchange the LA Studio shared about their incredible 1811 Sacramento Street project and how the initial façade was generated, explored, evaluated then later transformed into a more rationalized design. Meanwhile, our Seattle Interiors Studio recently designed a new office for MCG Health that beautifully reflects both the client’s as well as Perkins and Wills’s values. They’ll highlight the pre-design processes that led the team to establish the tone and character of the overall design. LA Studio The façade design of a building is a crucial element in achieving the big idea of creating an outdoor biophilic workspace for the project 1811 Sacramento St. The LA Studio’s presentation, presented by Dean Demko and Max Hu, discussed how the initial façade ideas were generated, explored, evaluated, and then later transformed into a more rationalized façade design. Max and Dean also covered the use of parametric design tools and provided examples of how these tools helped overcome various design challenges. Eventually, they delved into the workflow and techniques used for transferring geometry from Rhino to BIM for documentation purposes. Click HERE to view the recording (start @13:08) Seattle Studio Our Seattle Studio’s Interior Principal Sidney Scarboro presented the MCG Health office that was just recently finished construction. Sidney highlighted our robust front-end process which delivered a non-traditional, inspirational workspace that maintained a tangible representation of their brand values. The project interview and the predesign development all took place remotely/online during early 2020, but the design team was able to keep collaborating with the client team through a series of virtual tools such as Miro . The design team then iterated on personas from the client team that led to an informed programming approach and ultimately delivered the final results that celebrate the company’s vision and success.

    "content": "During the last firmwide webcast, Phil talked about our new in-house developed PMTK or Project Management Toolkit. This portion of the project app is replacing the vision resource planning module in Deltek that helped us budget and staff our projects across the firm. We are making this change to make the management side of our projects as simple and agile as possible. Bringing together the staffing, schedule, budgets, and contracts into one tool will allow PMs a holistic view of their project(s). We are currently in the data migration period this week and starting next week we are excited that we will be managing our projects through the PMTK in the Project App on Hub. This change brings many supporting apps and upcoming improvements to the Project App as well. This is not changing where we do our timesheets and expense reports, which will still all happen in vision for everyone. The supporting apps will include the following Finance app – For budget approval process by operations and finance Studio Staffing – for overall staffing at your studio level to make sure everyone is busy MySchedule – to see your upcoming assignments of projects and hours Time Off – to record approved time off to feed the calendars and staffing apps Request Vision Number (future) – to review and create new numbers for projects Other supporting apps are upcoming Project Map – to lay out all our project locations geographically Storyboard 2.0 – to manage design at the studio level Living Design 2.0 – to manage performance design aspects of projects at the studio level ClientHub – to share basic aspects of the project with our client in one central and simple location This is initial release is not the end of development to make management agile and simple but instead the beginning. Please make use of the feedback button on the side of any Hub page to let us know if something is not working or if you have an idea to make the tools better for everyone.",

    "content": "In July 2020, we made an announcement that Perkins&Will would no longer be upgrading SketchUp. Since then, many teams have transitioned to using Rhino for conceptual design and analysis, taking advantage of the recent interoperability improvements that connect Rhino and Revit. We have conducted several training sessions to help teams efficiently deploy design workflows on this new platform, and you can access them by clicking on this link . For those who are still using SketchUp, we would like to remind you that using files or plugins developed for newer versions of SketchUp, particularly Enscape, may lead to compatibility issues. There is no roadmap for determining which plugins will remain compatible with SketchUp 2020, and as new versions of these plugins are released, some may inevitably stop working. If you have any questions about SketchUp’s plugin compatibility issues or would like to arrange Rhino training to migrate your team to a more powerful design platform, please contact me.",

We’ll be hosted on our PWU channel from here on out. Ultimately, we’re hoping the Studio Innovation eXchange will: Acts as an opportunity for studio’s to present projects, workflows, or practices that they’re excited about to the whole firm so that we can collectively learn from them. With the intent to showcase all the great work that you and your studios are doing that don’t necessarily have a platform for The intent is to engage in a greater dialog and with that in mind, each Studio Innovation eXchange format will vary but will always be viewed as a discussion/forum first and foremost.

    "content": "It has been an exciting and productive year for the Digital Practice team at Perkins&Will. We have said goodbye to some old apps, including Newforma, and introduced some new ones, such as Power BI , Power Query , and Twin Motion . In addition to these technological advances, we have also partnered with Zahner metals to create new advanced workflows and released MicroKnowledge 3.0 , our updated repository of answers to frequently asked questions about our design applications. One of the major milestones of the past year has been the growth of our Artifact application, which has gained a wealth of knowledge and will soon surpass 100,000 drawing records. We have also conducted a user survey to gather feedback and create new features for the application. Another important achievement is further development of AreaSync –  a tool for dynamic analysis and visualization of data from our Revit and Rhino projects which helps guide design decisions. One more highlight was the use of a robot from Dusty Robotics to deliver a 1:1 scale floor plan for the Enchanted Hills camp in San Francisco. In addition to these technological developments, we have also made great strides in continuing education and innovation. We have held four internal conferences, called Core Exchange, and introduced a new Computational Design library. We are also exploring the use of digital twins for our new London studio at 150 Holborn street. Our robotic arm, Armando, even helped the Vancouver studio design a space for Microsoft. Members of the digital practice team have also presented at numerous conferences, and sponsored a symposium focused on design, equity, and data for the national AIA TAP knowledge group. All of these efforts have contributed to our goal of staying at the forefront of the industry and delivering the best possible results for our clients.",

This bad boy is here to make your life a whole lot easier by automating the process and giving you all the tools you need to calculate areas with speed and accuracy. One of the coolest features of AreaSync Rhino is the ability to import an area program spreadsheet. This means you can easily bring all your data into the software and skip the tedious process of inputting everything manually. But wait, there’s more! AreaSync Rhino can also auto-generate geometry for your program rooms, including both 2D curves and volumes. This gives you more control and flexibility over your calculations. Plus, you can assign custom parameters to your rooms to tailor your calculations to your specific needs. Visualization is key when it comes to calculating areas, and AreaSync Rhino has got you covered. It provides quick and easy visualization of totals and subtotals using charts and tables, so you can see how your calculations are progressing and catch any potential issues. Assign parameters to geometry and visualize it! And the best part? AreaSync Rhino gives you instant feedback while you’re re-sizing your geometry and comparing options. This means you can experiment and fine-tune your calculations without having to wait for results. When you’re done, you can easily sync or export your data to Excel or our cloud platform for building PowerBI dashboards. This makes it easy to share your results with clients or collaborate with team members. To celebrate the release of AreaSync Rhino, our Danish office threw a little shindig on December 15th and even had an AreaSync cake (delicious!). We’re confident that this software is going to be a game-changer for Rhino users and make calculating areas a breeze. Don’t miss out – give AreaSync Rhino a try today! Tust us, you won’t be disappointed. Stay tuned for AreaSync Core eXchange coming mid January! Want to try out AreaSync yourself? Follow this guide:",

    "content": "The Digital Practice team has prepared Revit 2023 for all new projects and recommends upgrading all existing projects. The software center has it for self-installation. Note that it is a big program, so it’s best to install it at the end of the day to allow ample time for downloading and installation. Add-ins will be installed on demand, and you can search for Revit 2023 add-ins using the software center’s filter. Autodesk Revit 2023 has introduced several new features that enhance the architectural design process. One notable feature is the inclusion of Twinmotion, a new visualization tool that allows designers to create more realistic renderings of their projects. This allows designers to better communicate their ideas and designs to clients, making the design process more efficient and effective. Another key feature of Revit 2023 is the ability to import and export data with other design software, such as Rhino. This allows for a seamless workflow between different design tools and allows for greater collaboration among team members. Additionally, the new version includes improved collaboration tools, such as real-time commenting and markup, making it easier for team members to share their feedback and suggestions. For more features check out this article . Each team should start planning and coordinating with external partners to find a time to upgrade to Revit 2023. Fortunately, upgrading using BIM360 is simple and only requires the click of a button. However, it’s important to note that all models for your project should be upgraded at the same time to ensure that everyone can continue to access all necessary information from each model. For new projects, it’s a good idea to start using the latest version of Revit from the beginning. Overall, the new features of Autodesk Revit 2023 improve the architectural design process by enhancing visualization, collaboration, and data interoperability.",

Dusty has created a robotic system that receives digital plan information and prints it full scale on floor slabs, eliminating the need for manual layout of partition framing, electrical devices, plumbing fixtures and any other information that we typically deliver via plan drawings. Luckily for us, the Enchanted Hills Forest Commons project was just about to begin construction and its small size and proximity to Dusty’s Bay Area home base made it an ideal candidate for a pilot. Digital Practice and the EHFC project team collaborated with Dusty to translate our Revit data into a format they could use and printing went ahead in early June. The pilot has been a resounding success and both we and Dusty are very excited about the possibilities this technology could open up for streamlining our documentation and eliminating questions and errors in the field.",

    "content": "Ghosts in the Project. Scary Halloween Story In a galaxy far away, one of the large projects was plagued by problems with disappearing dimensions and tags. Warning and errors like these were happening every day, and sometimes hundreds of elements were affected. This massive problem at 95% CD was very frustrating to the team. While team was battling ghosts in a very organized way (posting  and addressing warnings as they happen in the Teams chat), a group of Ghostbusters worked to uncover why it was happening so much on this particular project. Here is what we learned: The project was using Documentation model approach , where all sheets existed in Documentation model, tagging and dimensioning  was also happening in Documentation model. Exterior and Interior model were linked to documentation model. The users routinely opened a second (and sometimes third) session of Revit to work in both documentation a Interior/Exterior model. The annotation disappeared at the time the documentation model was synced. Moreover, the disappeared tags could not be reconciled when a link was reloaded because their elements IDs in reconciliation report were lost (set to “-1”). Also, the team is particularly large, and count of users concurrently in documentation model was often more then a dozen. At this time it was too late to rethink  model organization. We had opened a case with Autodesk, but they could not provide quick fix, and were not able to reproduce the problem. The project team had good prior  experience with such model organization (couple of years ago), and so we suspected that this time the problem is somehow connected to this project being on BIM 360 and multiple session of Revit sharing the same cache. When we again encountered a situation where  syncing would orphan more then a hundred tags and delete some dimensions, one of the ghostbusters on the team had a genius idea to sync from a different machine (node). It worked! Lessons learned: Avoid organizing your models with “Documentation” model. It is best to keep sheets in the files you will be actually editing If using “Documentation” model, sync linked file first, then in the documentation model reload linked model prior to syncing. If you are still getting warnings about disappearing dimensions and tags, cancel sync, connect to the node and sync there. Then close Revit on your machine without syncing documentation model, clear BIM360 cache (script in Software Center) and reopen. If using keynoting on the project, install Keynote Manager for every user on the team, regardless of whether they need to edit keynotes. At this time the case is still under investigation with Autodesk Development team.",

    "content": "This past month Digital Practice represented Perkins&Will at the first annual Microsoft Power Platform Conference, held in Orlando.  The conference brought together power users and developers from across the globe to discuss and share their work within Microsoft’s emerging suite of tools.  But what is the Microsoft Power Platform?  The Power Platform is a suite of low-code products that work and connect to all of Microsoft 365s products, database storage, and third party applications.  This interconnecting web between programs allows teams to create customized workflows unique to either the team or individual users. That all sounds nice, but how does it help our teams.  How easy is it to pick up?  To understand that we need to breakdown the different parts of the Power Platform and open up our imagination.  At its core, we are talking about: PowerBI – Business Analytics Dashboards PowerApps – Low level of entry application development PowerAutomate – Automation for workflows PowerPages – Quick externally facing websites Power Virtual Agents – Programmable chatbots for conversational data retrieval. The key components of the Microsoft Power Platform Primarily with the first three tools, we can interconnect our data sources with our Microsoft products, Teams included, and create tools in a matter of hours.  Not only does each tool come packed with templates to get your mind churning, the Power Platform community is extremely helpful in the public forums.  In a world of emerging technology, each of these tools is surprisingly user friendly, and the results of our workflows can save us valuable time throughout the design process. Available Templates within PowerAutomate This new area of exploration is open to anyone within Perkins&Will, and can be reached by going to the following websites: PowerBi , PowerApps , and PowerAutomate .  While you poke around the templates, here are some examples on how we can leverage these tools: Program solutions to create outward facing dashboards, such as AreaSync, with PowerBI Create applications to find the perfect wall type for your project, with PowerApps Automatically scheduling the next available meeting when someone messages you in Teams, with PowerAutomate Speeding up your CCA workflows by having Submittals automatically saved into a Sharepoint folder and creating a tracking line item in Planner or Lists, with PowerAutomate",

This call showcases work from different offices and promotes peer-to peer discussions. On Thursday September 22 we saw outstanding presentations from  three different offices: Austin, Miami and Seattle Austin Studio – Sadra Dehghan presented Utilizing BIM360 for Campus Assessments. Miami Studio – Damian Ponton did  a live demonstration of bringing geometry back and forth between Rhino and Revit using RhinoInside. Seattle Studio- William Franklin will showed a Grasshopper script to rapidly prototype skin design alternatives, then combined it with a script to randomly locate, scale and rotate Enscape entourage assets to render high quality concept imagery for projects in early design phases. Austin Studio Sadra Dehghan Sadra Dehghan from Austin Studio shared a great example of creatively using different tools for Campus Assessments. Austin’s Urban Design Team utilized BIM360’s Issues and Excel to perform building assessments. Once the data was collected, they used Area Sync and Power BI to present the information to the Client. The client was so impressed with results, the team was asked to do additional work utilizing additional facility management data provided by the client. Using the dashboard with this additional data, the client was able to better understand efficiency of their existing spaces, leading into informed discussion about how much square footage they need in new building. Miami Studio Damian Ponton Damian Ponton from Miami Studio did a live demonstration of bringing geometry back and forth between Rhino and Revit using RhinoInside. He showed us simple steps needed to create a Grasshopper script for bringing geometry created in Rhino as native Revit categories. Then Damian took us on the round trip journey taking Revit elements to Rhino for additional editing For the teams thinking of utilizing this workflow, Damian  analyzed and evaluated pros and cons of modeling in Rhino versus Revit. Seattle Studio William Franklin William Franklin from Seattle Studio tool us on the mind blowing journey from initial massing concept through rapid design iteration  to a rendering high quality images. He showed us quick look at a Grasshopper script used to interpret initial massing concepts and rapidly prototype skin design alternatives in real time by panelizing massing surfaces and creating Rhino block objects using Human/Elefront components. Then he showed us how to combine it with with a script to randomly locate, scale and rotate Enscape entourage assets to quickly test design ideas and render high quality concept imagery for projects in early design phases.",

    "content": "We build 3D models to create our documents because we know that it is easier to coordinate. Contractors also want to use our models since they want them for pre-construction coordination. However, there is still another group of folks who are part of our project who still have not captured the potential of the models we produce — our clients. Now it is worth acknowledging that not every client is going to be able to make use of a 3D model as effectively as others of our clients. Generally, the clients for whom a 3D model will have the greatest value are our institutional clients who have a large portfolio of buildings that are frequently remodeled, updated and for whom the operation aspect is a large part of their budget. For these clients, we have real opportunity to educate them about how using the models we generate to not only improve the flow of information through construction, but more importantly how it can improve the flow of information into the operation phase as old building equipment assets are removed and new ones are placed and commissioned. Additionally, for these clients who understand the value of a model for their long term operations, they will also find the ability to locate and view building equipment assets in 3D reduces the time it takes perform maintenance and inspections. Also, for these clients, having a model they can pass on to the next team (or back to us) will reduce the amount of effort it takes to start a new renovation project. While these are things we have talked about and theorized for over a decade now, we take it for granted that not all of our institutional clients have made this move. We have the opportunity not only to not only help this sector of clients who are likely to be frequent repeat clients and solidify our relationship with them, but we also have the opportunity to improve on our existing sales with these clients for work we are already well positioned to provide.",

    "content": "Artificial Intelligent generated images have been a hot topic in the news lately, supplanting NFT’s and the Metaverse. DALL-E2, Midjourney and others have taken the “prompted” art-world by storm.  The reason is there have been many breakthroughs in this field that allow computers to learn and make decisions like humans. However, one area where AI has not yet made its mark is image creation. AI has finally reached a point where the technology can be used to create images based on an algorithm rather than just recognize them. The first step towards creating an image was recognizing what you were seeing in real-time, like when a camera could tell if your face was in the frame or if there was a dog running around behind it. This type of activity was called computer vision, and the results were pretty impressive for tasks like facial recognition and object detection (like seeing if there’s a cat sitting on your couch). But generating an image from scratch? That was another ballgame entirely. AI can be trained to create images from text prompts. The training data helps the AI understand how real people would form an image and this helps it to generate new ones. This new technology has many possible applications. With AI image creation, anyone can create unique new images without having to learn how to use complicated programs. For designers, uses cases may include material, vision or are what sometimes are called precedent boards, without infringing on copyright or showing our competitors work. Another use case may be to to generate  materials and entourage for renderings. Designers from across the firm, from Charlotte to Miami to Vancouver and more have been experimenting with this new technology. Examples from a recent workshop in the Vancouver studio are below.  Will Finley from the Dallas studio has set up a Discord server, so anyone can try out this new technology for themselves and see what they can create. Here’s How to try Midjourney: Join the Perkins&Will Digital Practice Discord server here . Chat directly with the Midjourney bot by typing “/imagine”, follow by hitting “spacebar”. This will activate the “prompt” box where you can start typing. Type in any words that come to mind, then hit enter. Just wait for the program to render through a series of passes. You can click on your image to open it in a new page, or if you want to re-render, simply click the “refresh” icon in the prompt. The AI will regenerate a unique image based on the same prompt you used.

    "content": "The Miami Studio recently purchased a DJI Mini Pro drone for project documentation and existing site documentation. Is your studio considering getting a drone? Here are some things to consider. If you have a small drone that is less than 55 pounds, you can fly for work or business by following the FAA Part 107 guidelines. If you will be operating the drone, you’ll need to Become an FAA-certified drone pilot by passing the Knowledge Test. You can get started here: https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators. Once you pass, you’re then eligible to apply for your Remote Pilot Certificate. Our insurance carrier will need to be notified of your studio’s purchase so the drone can be added to their coverage. You can reach out to Noah Green from our Seattle studio for more information. We’re happy to say that Shiyin Zeng from the Miami Studio recently passed her exam and is now awaiting certification. She was kind enough to put together some advice on taking the exam. It’s important to note that the studio invested in the Drone Launch Academy Online Course training material which made a difference in the studying process. We highly recommend it. https://dronelaunchacademy.com/ If you want to connect with other firmwide drone enthusiasts, join this Teams. UAV/Drone User Group Below are Shiyin’s recommendations. Good luck! ” Before the exam: Read the official Remote Pilot – Unmanned Aircraft System Study Guide Finish the Drone Launch Academy Online Course (this is more helpful, finish it anyway) Regulation: Remote Pilot in Command (RPIC) Responsible for inspection/ must have certification/ other people person manipulating the controls must be under direct supervisor Careless or reckless: failing to take adverse weather into consideration See and avoid: Remote pilots are required to give-way and yield to ALL other aircraft in the sky. Flight at night: Your drone must have anti-collision lights that are visible from 3 statute miles and has a sufficient flash rate to avoid a collision. Remote ID: https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/remote_id Remote ID broadcast module: A broadcast module is a device that broadcasts identification and location information about the drone and its take-off location in accordance with the remote ID rule’s requirements. Radio Communications Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF) : airport with no tower, self-report (and you can find the explanation of CTAF and ATIS in the legend if you don’t remember) MULTICOM: 122.9 UNICOM: non-government ground stations, generally found at low-traffic general aviation airports: Weather information/ Wind direction/ Recommended runway, and/ Any previously reported traffic Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS): recorded information relevant to a certain station – usually an airport. Weather/ active runways/ navigation equipment outages/ and potential hazards Airspace and Reading Sectional Charts: Very important!! Need to understand all content in the online course. AGL & MSL!! Always check the legend if anything you are not sure Victor airway Altitude boundaries (All number on the sectional chart map are in MSL) Effects of Weather Temperature and Dew Point: fog/freeze precipitation/… Low level windshear Temperature and performance: https://www.aeromotus.com/information-for-drone-users/how-weather-affects-your-drone-s-performance/ METAR and TAF: valid time/ wind info Loading and Performance The four forces: weight/ lift/ thrust/ drag The influence of the location of CG (center of gravity): Aft-unstable The relationship of center of gravity(CG) and stall: If the CG is too far to the rear on a fixed-wing UAV, the unmanned aircraft will have a very difficult time recovering from a stall Load factor calculation based on the chart. Airport Operations: Towered/ Uncontrolled Towered/ Non-Towered/ Heliport / Seaplane Bases Emergency Procedures: Frequency Interference: usually with office building in exam Lost of GPS: the sUAS may not automatically hold its altitude, correct for wind, or brake when forward control is released. Maintenance and Inspection: Record Keeping: This could be done by documenting any repair, modification, overhaul, or replacement of a system component resulting from normal flight operations, and recording the time-in-service for that component at the time of the maintenance procedure. Physiology Alcohol: Regulations require that blood alcohol level be less than .04 percent and that 8 hours pass between drinking alcohol and piloting an unmanned aircraft. Stimulants: produce anxiety and mood swings, both of which are dangerous when flying. Acute Stress and Chronic Stress Night Vision: The rods can take approximately 30 minutes to fully adapt to darkness.

    "content": "For our 2022 Q3 VizR eXchange, Scott Schroeder shared an interactive display project as well as some of his explorations in Twinmotion. The Denver office was asked by their Pepperdine University client to help them create an interactive 3D model that facilitates their Donor Naming campaign for the new stadium project. Our team was asked to create an iPad application that visitors can use to interact with the 3D model. As they touch certain sections of the stadium map, the physical model of that section lights up, and a rendered scene of the field from that section shows up on a large screen monitor above the model. The team involved two consultant agencies to help with the project. Archtype3D created the physical 3D model and Neoscape created the iPad application that drives the interaction while our team produced all the visual imageries and animation content for the visual display. The final model was presented at a fundraising event and was wildly successful, and the model will eventually be displayed on campus for the public to interact with it. The second half of the VizR call was focused on the discussion of using Twinmotion for visualization projects. Scott is impressed with the new features of Twinmotion and listed some good reasons why Twinmotion could be used for future visualization projects. Scott discussed the ease of integrating Twinmotion into the projects through the use of Datasmith to link the live Revit/Rhino model to Twinmotion, and the access to the Sketchfab 3D library, especially for their extensive tree selections that can be used to swap out Enscape’s tree blocks.

    "content": "Back in 2016(!) we were asked by the DAR steering group what was possible technology wise, for our new London headquarters at 150 High Holborn. Via a series of high level “BIM” presentations we set about trying to show what might be possible. One presentation slide finished with the YouTube video of the Deloitte building in the Netherlands and I think that was a bit of a defining moment. The feedback was great. “We want Smart We want Intelligent We want one of the most tech advanced buildings in the world…. “ If you haven’t seen this building it’s worth a scan of the QR code. Bear in mind this was 2016, there may have been some marketing applied to the video but you get the idea. We didn’t really know at that moment what technology would enable by the time we come to construct some 5 years later but we did know that to enable a smooth transition we would need to deliver robust and structured handover data in an easy to digest, open and useable format. So what do we mean by structured data? The easiest way to explain connected/structured data is to start at the end and show what is possible at Handover. The image above isn’t a BIM or Revit model this is just a view of a database . All objects contain predetermined fields of data for use in operation by the FM teams. As an example we have selected an Extract Fan here and all of the data attached to that piece of modelled equipment can be seen in the properties dialogue boxes on the right. Where it is in the building It’s Unique Asset Reference Who supplied and manufactured it It’s maintenance schedule And links to its o&m and user manual We are highlighting here that if all of this information comes out of a database, then we have a single repository rather than lots of fragmented unchecked information. And because we can set up this database right at the start of the design process it gives us the single source of structured data from the outset. BUT this doesn’t just happen, somebody needs to ensure that ALL parties enter the required information at the correct time by forming a set of rules known. The rules specify at a very granular level who needs to deliver what and when. Establishing these rules, setting up the requirements, making sure they are adhered to are all part of the role of the Information manager. This diagram above attempts to break the role down into simple steps. Step 1 – is understanding what is required and then feeding into a database platform*. Teams will then be assigned a responsibility to provide the applicable information. Step 2 – Is validating this information has been input as directed. Step 3 – shows the output records/reports at each data drop / stage end – The input required is minimal during early design stages and ramps up during construction. Step 4 – is the goal of connected data we just spoke about The other important aspect of the information manager role is that an outside party aside from the main contractor is validating that the information has been input as required. * We work with a partner company who provides this platform https://digitalpractice.perkinswill.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Media1.mp4 This short video shows our data model progression to date.  All elements are assigned a very simple unique identification code in Revit. This unique ID code is then the hook to all the other data types associated with handover / delivery information Things such as classification code, Fire Rating,  Location in the building etc. These can all be input via a variety of applications rather than just parameters in clunky Revit. As the video plays you will understand this is a geometric model view of the database , not the Revit model. When we select objects we have instant access to the other asset information that has been populated in the database. The video shows the user choosing the barriers and speed gates and as the objects are selected, we can see we have links to much richer, extended information. We are also able to view the same data via an O&M manual type of display. It is because the data is input in an organized and structured fashion that we are able to view it in a number of ways Just to expand a little on the flexibility aspect, once we have this in an open and structured format, the same data can be connected / imported / exported and viewed in a variety of formats and applications to display other information sets. Add in IOT / sensor devices and you can begin to monitor live building use, well being , comfort, performance , co2 levels etc etc The static design data can then be compared to live these live data feeds to see if the asset / room or function is performing as expected. Which starts us moving to the realms of what is known as Digital Twin. So has this asset information delivery caught on? Well yes it really has. What’s interesting is that when we take away all of the BIM nonsense (acronym, jargon, confusion) and explain in a simple way, what a client can get at the end of their project, there is often an instant understanding of the value this can bring. We have since embedded these processes on a number of other projects and are also seeing the requests for these standardized ways of working becoming the norm in any significant sized project RFP. It really does seem to be becoming more and more about the data. The next part to this post will attempt to show the plan for how this data will be connected to a smart platform in operation.

    "content": "Thank You! Thank You! Thank You for taking the Artifact User Survey! Many of you rose to the call of our previous newsletter post to the Artifact User Survey and provided thoughtful feedback on how to make Artifact more useful for you. Here are a few responses to the most frequent comments we received. We will be implementing many of the requested features soon. Thanks for helping us make Artifact better! “Love Artifact! Can you add more content?” Your most frequent comment was that you wanted more projects in Artifact. With apologies to  Smokey the Bear ‘Only YOU can add more content!’ Ask the project leaders in your studio and your Technical Director for projects to add and reach out to Luc Deckinga for assistance in adding them. “Can you identify which drawings on Artifact have Revit content and which only have images?” When a Revit project is added to Artifact all views are converted to drafting views. We added the ability to download .RVT files containing those drafting views and all associated detail items and graphic styles from Artifact just over a year ago. It is our goal to provide Revit content for 100% of the views in Artifact, but projects that were added before that feature was implemented did not capture that Revit content. We are working through these older projects to bring in that Revit content. All projects added going forward will have this Revit content available. We are also investigating how to capture additional Revit content in the future, including 3D families. “Is there a mechanism for identifying standard drawings or content that has been approved by my Technical Director? We believe drawing sets from all completed Perkins&Will projects deserve to be on Artifact. If you want to curate a set of curated or approved views you can accomplish that in several ways: Create a Collection in Artifact. Add preferred views found throughout the entire Artifact library. Share with your team/studio. Create a Revit project with the desired views. Set the Project Name parameter in Revit how you want it to display in the Artifact sidebar under the ‘Project’ filter. Add to Artifact using BIM360. We are looking at other ways to capture additional information about the content on Artifact. We encourage you to use the ‘like’ button available now. Additionally, we are experimenting with the ability to comment on each view. Please reach out if you would like to have a voice in these development efforts. “Some of the sheets in my Revit file aren’t part of the final drawing set. Can I exclude those from being added to Artifact?” We currently add all views that have been placed on sheets in the Revit project to Artifact. You will soon be able to identify a particular sheet set to harvest. This is how we organize our drawing sets within Revit, so it makes sense to use that organization for Artifact. This will keep drawings that aren’t part of the final project deliverable out of the system. “Can we find a project on Artifact by project number?” If you have worked on a project for a significant time you have the project number ingrained in your brain. While it is not currently a part of the Artifact UI, if you type the project number with the 3-digit extension (e.g. 123456.000) it will show exact matches. We are upgrading the search function to return results without the 3-digit extension (e.g. 123456) ‘Can Artifact filter projects by location?” While there is not currently a way to filter projects by location you could get a rough project location by filtering to a particular studio. We realize this is not very precise and are looking at ways to sort by State, Country, or Region. “Does Artifact understand drawings with keynotes?” Yes! Drawings with keynotes will show up in search results if you search for a term referenced in the notes. The tag to note translation is shown at the bottom of the Artifact right sidebar. What’s Next for Artifact? More content and more features to make it more useful for you. Stay tuned in the coming months for new updates and check back frequently for new content that I’m sure you will all be adding! Thanks for making Artifact a success!",

    "content": "Armando, the firms robotic arm has been stranded in Vancouver for months due to Covid. The studios in-house experts in robotic and digital fabrication have continued to  experiment and search out practical uses for robotics in architecture.  Last month, Armando had a big day: it performed a live demonstration session for a Vancouver client! The live demo was a significant proof-of-concept for a feature wall in the Microsoft Swing Space project. Marc Johannknecht and Babak Manavi captured the demo session – check out this awesome video by Marc: The Robotics Prototype is part of a larger swing space project, intended to be a temporary space for Microsoft for the next 3 to 5 years. The temporary nature of a swing space (higher risk tolerance) presented an opportunity to experiment with atypical methodologies. The site has a dramatic entry portal from the previous fit-out: We set out to salvage and re-use as much as possible on this project due to its temporary nature. For the portal, the question we asked ourselves was: is it possible to introduce a new design without using new materials? Instead of using the default paint / film to re-clad or re-finish the portal, we proposed a subtractive method: to carve into the existing painted MDF panels with a new design. The team worked closely with @Manuela to provide embodied carbon assessment for each of the design options: paint, film, new wood cladding, etc. The graphic film option, a popular default material, was ruled out because of its relatively high global warming potential. A subtractive option, in a conventional delivery model, requires skilled labour to de-construct/re-install the panels, carefully transport to/from the millwork shop. This quickly became cost-prohibitive. The  millwork contractor also warned of high likelihood that the panels will be damaged from the process because they were not designed for dis-assembly. Armando, stranded in Vancouver thanks to Covid, and our in-house expertise in robotic and digital fabrication made it possible to continue to pursue our preferred approach. A lot of effort went into making this possible. Huge thank you to everyone on the team: Core team – Naomi, Manuela, Wendy Experiential Graphic Design – Colette Research & Robotics Prototype Team – Yehia, Mahdiar, Sebastien, Janna, Marco, Thomas Armando’s Gallery – Mahdiar, Marco, Rick, Akiko",

    "content": "Our two Danish studios visited Oslo for a three-day study tour at the beginning of June. The main aims of the trip was to learn more about building in timber, adaptive transformations, urban development and explore our own projects. Interesting places that we visited on the first day of the trip: Storhamarlåven Storhamarlåven is designed by the pioneer in adaptive transformation and Norwegian architect – Sverre Fern. It is a restoration project of an old barn build on top of the bishop castle form over 1000 years ago with a lof of contrasting steel, glass and concrete. Valle Wood Valle Wood is 60 000 m2 office + business complex located in northeast of central Oslo. Valle Wood distinguishes out as a pavilion in the vicinity with a noticeable, solid wood construction. The structure has a BREEAM excellence certification and uses 40% less energy than comparable office buildings. When Valle Wood was constructed, it was the largest all-wood commercial structure in Norway. Ingierstrand bath The first day finished with the dinner by the Oslofjord in Ingierstrand Bad Restaurant. It is an icon in Norwegian modern architectural history and is considered one of the main works in Norwegian functionalist architecture. The architects themselves stated that their goal was to adapt the buildings to the hilly terrain “so that the landscape beauty is emphasized and the area is not over-furnished” On a second day we were joined by inspirational speakers, held an internal sustainability workshop prepared by Enlai Hooi and Ellen Berglund and explored the city with local guides. Sustainability workshop The goal of the sustainable workshop was to share knowledge by instructing all staff members on how to use our SHL Cards and our sustainability procedures. We regard talent development as a vital asset that will help our studio advance. Additionally, a flat hierarchy fosters an ambitious and secure environment for experimentation because knowledge across disciplines is disseminated widely rather than held by a small number of experts. By implementing our SHL Cards, which map out qualities, processes, tools, blind spots, and questions in every project we design, we ensure a studious, analytical, and innovative approach and tailored outcome. The great diversity of our team is an invaluable strength and a workshop and trip such as this highlights how a workplace thrives on the cultural enlightenment and creative clashes that come with it. Explorer During the trip we also launched our new web tool Explorer – created in collaboration between Digital Practice and Business and Development department. Explorer helps BD team, project leaders and designers explore sustainability stories behind our projects so that we can replicate the success on the new projects and recall how they were implemented. SHL’s awesome projects in Oslo: VIA VIA is a mixed-use building in the modernist Vika area in Oslo and in a larger scope the most recent project in the ongoing transformation of Ruseløkkveien and Vika. The project successfully creates a new public plaza in the middle of a previously closed city block. The visual links through the site are anchored in the four open corners that lead people into the center. The façades respond to the two different environments: towards the streets, a stone-clad grid façade fitting for the modernist Vika heritage, towards the courtyard, a warm vertical “forest” surrounding the 12 m skylight. More on Via here: https://www.shl.dk/ruseloekkveien/ NIO The Chinese car brand NIO are expanding to the European market and opened in 2021 their first European showroom in Oslo. The interior concept is based on friendly Scandinavian traditions, natural materials and with the notion of a fjord landscape where the dominant elements are water, mountains and the sky above. The NIO House is open to public and its centerpiece is the large community wooden staircase. And cars!

It was designed by the C.C.C and Health Care teams from São Paulo office , alongside the Atlanta design team . The co-designing scenario required organization, communication and the rationalization of resources at all times. The team gave us a brief overview. This presentation was a teaser preview, and more detailed presentation and discussion is scheduled for August 22 – stay tuned. Tools and resources updates We did not have DD calls for a while, so there is quite a lot of updates to our tools and resources Superdoors update for 2022 was presented by Helen Gorina. These doors are now available from HIVE as well as Supedoor tool. The most significant improvement is the fact that the panels nested inside the door assembly will not tag, so there is not confusion, no extra clicks or tabbing, and no swearing when tagging the doors. And you can use Tag All commands with superdoors now. Updates to PW casework pack was presented by Helen Gorina. Initially Firmwide casework package was introduced in April 2021, here is the link https://vimeo.com/536850888 password “DA” Since then, we rolled out significant improvements Casework tag is now stacked We developed and published additional cabinets requested by Practices additional details for Practices are in development and will be published soon Added images for recycling decals We thank everyone who gave us feedback and guidance which made these improvements possible. Jeremy Luebker gave an overview of Code compliance workflow which was developed, improved and rolled out in all 2022 US templates. Thanks everyone who gave us feedback to make these improvements possible, and please continue to give us feedback so we can make your workday better.",

We’ve developed a set of software tools that plug into our shared design platform to support a frictionless, collaborative workflow. Check out this post about our recent workshop at the FacadesPlus conference in New York City. Outside of our collaboration, Zahner has additionally developed tools to accurately visualize their range of metal materials. “Exploring the ecosystem of material combinations can be a monumental undertaking and a rabbit hole for design professionals. In an effort to address the challenge, the Zahner Labs team has built a web tool to explore the vast design space of material selection and comparison. The MaterialComposer project aims to make exploration effortless, surprising, and fun – while making sourcing, selection and specification a breeze.” Go to https://www.azahner.com/labs/materialcomposer/ for an online preview, then download drag-and-drop Rhino materials to visualize these materials on your own design.",

    "content": "800+ Users and Over 40,000 drawings! Thank you so much for making Artifact a success! Help us make it even better by taking this short survey. It’s six questions and won’t take more than two minutes. Honest. https://forms.reform.app/480arH/make-us-better-artifact Artifact was made for you! We want to know how you use Artifact and what additional features you would like to see added. Those who have been with us for a while have seen the site evolve, with improved harvesting, search functionality, and seamless Revit and BIM 360 Integrations. We want to continue these improvements and need you to guide our efforts. Thank you for taking the time to help! I Forget, What is Artifact? How do I log in? Artifact is a collaboration between AIPrentice, a software developer, and Perkins&Will’s Digital Practice department.  As a reminder to anyone who hasn’t logged in for a while, Artifact is the drawing search site that turns text and metadata in your Revit drawings into searchable terms, so you find exactly the drawing you’re looking for and adapt it to a new project. To log in with your Perkins&Will credentials, go to Pwitter (green arrow) > Microsoft MyApps > Artifact. Add More Drawings to Artifact, Please? Artifact is only as good as the content within, so we are asking you to contribute your studio’s work. Please talk to the technical and design leadership within your studio to identify at least one or two projects to include, and coordinate with your Digital Practice representative, or Digital Practice Manager Luc Deckinga, to add your content. Show off your work to the rest of Perkins&Will! We currently have 44,847 drawings in the Artifact database, taken from 69 completed projects designed by ten different Perkins&Will studios. It would be great to hit 100,000 drawings (mostly because we like round numbers :), but it is a more important milestone to have every studio represented in Artifact with at least one project. Thanks for all your help and support!",

    "content": "Nathan Barnes, Luc Deckinga, and Mario Romero gave a workshop demonstrating the Zahner/Perkins&Will collaborative workflow at Facades+ New York on March 31, 2023. Frustrated by loops of rework and wasted time, Perkins&Will envisioned a more collaborative and dynamic feasibility review process for its fabrication and construction partners, a process that would allow more design time and speed up decisions. Working with like-minded leaders at fabrication partner Zahner, the two firms invented a shared workspace and feasibility model that produces higher design fidelity, shorter delivery schedules, and more joyful clients and communities. Learn more about this process and how it can be adapted for your work and how process improvements like this can be implemented between many partners for faster, better collaborations. In the design process, details inevitably change. Big or small, these alterations can cost everyone extra time and money if they aren’t communicated clearly. We asked: “Is it possible to exchange model and design data directly with fabricators so they better understand our intent?” Together we developed a cloud-enabled 3D modeling workflow that reduces design revisions and achieves higher-quality results for our clients. Dubbed the “Dynamic Design and Feasibility Workflow,” this process is centered on workspaces and tools shared by the teams, as well as regular reviews of both Perkins&Will’s and Zahner’s work. By adopting this process both teams realize increased efficiency and more design confidence, along with precise cost estimates and accurate production schedules.

    "content": "Presented by: Michael Vollrath To kickstart our 2022 Quarterly VizR meeting, Michael showcased his Grasshopper scripts that automate entourage placement inside Revit for Enscape visualization. Placing entourage elements such as people and cars to fill a scene can sometimes be a tedious and time-consuming task, Michael Vollrath set out to solve that problem by finding an easy way to automate the placement of these elements in a dynamic and intelligent way that doesn’t look too repetitive and robotics but just random enough to create a realistic scene. Michael created two grasshopper scripts with two very creative and descriptive names called “Butt in Seats” and “Lots of Cars”. Just as the name implies, “Butt in Seats” will place seated people on elements identified as seats, and “Lots of Cars” will fill the parking lot with many more cars. The concept is simple enough for anyone to understand and use. Michael then went a few more steps further to make the scripts flexible enough to allow customization in entourage selection to fit the need of project scenes. For example, the seated people can be filtered for age range and outfit style, so you can customize your corporate office scene with business people aged 18 – 60 years old, versus a hospital lobby scene that will be filled with casual styled people of all different age group. The “Lots of Cars” also offer customization, such as filling the parking lot to the level of density specified, and allowing you to identify doors as entrances to the facility, so the cars will fill up starting with spots closest to the entrance first. For more details about the scripts, watch the meeting recording HERE .",

Newforma has lived in the inboxes and file folders of our projects for many years.   It is survived by Outlook, Excel, and its grandkids Procore, PlanGrid, and others.   Newforma is preceded in death by ProjectDox, AutoCad, Vasari, Ecotect, Autodesk Impression, dRofus, and others.   In its early days, Newforma was a favorite of all the technical and organized people who wanted a better way to organize their project communication and information. Newforma will be laid to rest this June at which time all remaining project work should adopt younger more modern tools to find better value and efficiency in the requirements we must complete during construction contract administration.   Because of its passing if your project hasn’t already been completed you should have a transition plan in place.   It should include understanding what the contractors use as a project information management software platform, understanding what your client might want to look at for completed RFI responses or submittal reviews, knowing how much time is left in the schedule to have a good estimate if you will have 100s more submittals to review and 100s or more RFIs to respond to.   We have recordings in our CCA Quickstart on how to efficiently deal with our CCA process to make the process more efficient for the remainder of your project.   Please reach out to your local Digital Practice team member to help assist you in planning your transition if there are any complications to what might be most effective for your specific project situation.",

Deadline Monitor helps maintain the availability of these machines for rendering, organizes past and present jobs, and maintains the rendering queue for everyone needing to render. Perkins&Will’s render farms are intended as a sharable resource. Deadline Monitor facilitates sharing. Supported Apps… What do I need? Install Deadline Monitor, V-Ray 5 from Software Center. F.A.Q. No V-Ray Licenses Available?! If this happens, please message Digital Practice . We are prepared to expand the number of licenses as the need increases. Unfortunately, the V-Ray Chaos license server software provides no log or other means of informing Digital Practice when the number of licenses are too few. We are depending on you to let us know each time licenses are unavailable. Thank you in advance. Can I Render from a Computational Node? Yes. To avoid negative attention always check the ‘Cap CPU Utilization” in Rhino and SketchUp or “Don’t Use Local Resources” in Revit when rendering from a computational node. Rendering Etiquette As a shared resource, it is important to practice good etiquette with others using the office render farm. This means splitting the resources for simultaneous use, refraining from escalating your job in front of others in the render queue and communicating with one another as needed. It is also important to clean up after your projects. Delete your old jobs once you no longer need them.  If your job has errors and you plan to request assistance from a Design Application Manager or other, do not delete the job. Deadline jobs log errors. These logs may help identify the cause of your error. Feedback Constructive criticism is always welcome, but letting us know if our efforts have been helpful is important too. If you have a suggestion to improve these resources let us know. Also if our work has been helpful to you please share this. It helps us better help you. If you have a positive story share we would love to hear it. We may even feature your story in Digital Practice’s monthly ReCap. Message the Digital Practice on our firmwide Visualization Teams channel .",

    "content": "Introduction The last decade has seen a change in how projects are staffed, managed, and led. Through the use of file transfer protocol (“FTP”) sites and cloud storage services, project teams are no longer tied to a single physical location. Today, it is more common to have a design team comprised of members from offices across multiple states working together on one project. This is especially true on projects of scale. The old but reliable way of communicating the construction progress was through field reports and digital photographs, transmitted via e-mail or posted to FTP sites. Some of the more sophisticated clients and contractors used webcams where anyone at any time could log on to check the status of construction. This later evolved into web-based platforms where daily logs, photographs, observations, and deficiencies could be uploaded and shared with anyone with internet access. The purpose of this document is to share some of the technologies and strategies used over a 6-year period during the Construction Contract Administration phase of the University of Virginia (UVA), University Hospital Expansion (UHE) project. It also includes some of the technological advances explored over the past 18-months of the pandemic. The Challenge The UVA UHE project included over 440,000 square feet of new construction and 90,000 square feet of renovation. The $268M project started in 2014 with the commencement of 7 enabling projects that made way for the new, 12-story patient tower. Fortunately, the owner requested full-time, on-site representation by the Design Team. At the commencement of the 6-year Construction Contract Administration (CCA) effort, the Perkins&Will DC Office Team set themselves the challenge of experimenting with the use of technology during CCA. Laser Scanning Laser scanning is an excellent example of a technology where while the quality of the scans has increased, the costs have become more accessible. What would previously have been a $250K exercise, laser scanning of existing buildings can now be performed for a fraction of the cost. The cost of the actual equipment, however, is not cheap. We recently worked with Skanska to have the exterior of the wind tunnel at Virginia Polytechnic and State University (Virginia Tech) scanned to import into Revit. Skanska uses the Leica RT360, which Leica describes as a “High-speed 3D laser scanner with integrated HDR spherical imaging system and Visual Inertial System (VIS) for real-time registration” 5. Weighing in at 11.7 lbs (w/o batteries), the Leica RT360 is capable of scanning up to 2 million points per second and has a range of up to 130 meters. The approximate cost of the Leica RT360 is more than 90 thousand dollars. Perkins&Will was awarded the Randolph Hall replacement project at Virginia Tech. In addition to the challenge of replacing the 1950s era engineering buildings, the Team is tasked with ensuring the existing wind tunnel, which is one of the largest university-owned stability wind tunnels in the United States6, stays operational 100% of the time during demolition and construction. The tunnel, which was originally built at the NACA Langley Aeronautical Laboratory in 1940, was acquired by Virginia Tech in 1958 and erected in 1959 in a specially designed wing of Randolph Hall. The as-built drawings only portray the overall shape of the tunnel and do not accurately depict the ribs, foundation piles, etc. As noted above, Perkins&Will worked with Skanska, the Construction Manager at Risk, to obtain a laser scan of the tunnel. Our hope was to obtain a point cloud scan of the structure to import into Revit for modeling. What we learned is that through inputting some survey points obtained by our civil engineer, we were able to scan the tunnel as it sits relative to the world: meaning that the scan/model is geospatially located. This means that when we bring the model into our Revit model, the tunnel is placed exactly where it sits within the world. Laser scanning is another example of an effective tool for on-site documentation and one where we expect the speed and quality of scans will only improve over time. The Pandemic No one would describe today’s Design and Construction Market as stable, consistent, and unchanging. Like most professions, the Design and Construction industry has been forced to adapt quickly to the ever-changing landscape of the pandemic: a landscape where working from home is now common and travel for work is limited. AIA Contracts state that the Architect’s role in construction is to: 1. Visit the site at intervals appropriate to the stage of construction 2. Become generally familiar with the progress and quality of the portion of the work completed 3. Determine, in general, if the Work observed is being performed in accordance with the Contract Documents7. Architects have therefore been challenged to find new and unique ways to complete their contractual obligations remotely. Using the previously mentioned strategies and technologies is an option but cannot and should not replace on-site representation. By way of example, once you see the quality of the Matterport or StructionSite’s virtual tours you may question why go to the site? The answer is because the technology is just not there… yet. While the photo-realistic tours are great for giving you a sense of the space and the level of completion, it would be impossible to perform a thorough review, especially when it comes to punch. And while virtual online 360 tours may facilitate inspections by the local Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ), you quickly learn that they cannot replace an in-person substantial completion or final completion review as there is simply too much at which to look. In-person reviews are still preferred over virtual, no matter what strategy, platform, or application you use. UVA UHE Construction Team thanking healthcare workers, April 16,2020 Virtual Galleries Virtual Galleries are another product of the pandemic. Where project interviews were previously held in person, the pandemic necessitated a move to virtual. During a Miami office pursuit, our Digital Practice team created a 3D gallery for use in presenting during a virtual interview. The gallery was created in Enscape and features 9 bays radiating from a central node. Content on the walls of each gallery is pulled from PowerPoint slides of the presentation. 3D models were also displayed in the central node and several of the bays. The audience was thoroughly impressed by our innovation and the use of technology to facilitate the guided tour of the gallery and associated presentation. Since then, the gallery format has been used as a template to create countless virtual galleries, an example of which is the UVA UHE gallery. https://vizlab.perkinswill.com/tours/uva/ Like Matterport models, anyone with the web address and an internet connection can access the model without the need for any additional plugins or applications. The user navigates the space similar to Google maps or a Matterport model. The user can interact with the images on the walls by clicking to enlarge the image to full screen. 3D models can be rotated 360 degrees to view the model from multiple angles. Links to Matterport scans drop the user into the interactive model and videos play at the click of a button. QR Codes are also embedded to facilitate participants in a virtual tour to jump into the gallery themselves and/or access select features. Conclusion As illustrated in the various examples, the exploration of the use of Technology can reap wonderful rewards. We simply must have the courage to be open to trying new things and be receptive to change. This however cannot be accomplished alone and requires the support of your company to expend resources, be it time, money, or both. The hope is that by sharing our findings and experiences, we can push the industry as a whole towards more efficient construction progress documentation. As mentioned above, we highly recommend the Matterport camera. Originally developed for the real estate industry to create virtual tours, it’s an incredible time-saving tool. Where field verification previously required multiple trips and countless hours reviewing drawings, markups, and photographs, it now can be performed by a single person in one visit. And the ability to share walkable models of completed spaces with potential clients is a huge step forward. Laser scanning is another example of a technology that we as architects should fully embrace. However, where purchasing a Matterport camera is a small investment that yields big returns, it may not make financial sense for your firm to own its own laser scanner. This is where partnering with a technologically savvy construction team help. Especially in complex additions and renovations, the ability to scan with pinpoint accuracy buildings and their various components is of huge benefit to the entire project team. The value of tried-and-true technologies such as webcams should not be overlooked. On the UHE, Skanska used real-time images to plan just-in-time deliveries. We also learned that emergency medical service (EMS) used the webcams to see what traffic conditions were like en route to the facility. And for an Owner, the value of the webcam goes beyond the ability to know what is occurring on-site at any time. Webcams add another level to the existing security monitoring system. Changes stemming from the Pandemic to our way of life, our way of doing business, are real. If it has taught us anything, it is the need to be more flexible and to have multiple means of communication. Virtual galleries and virtual site tours are now an integral part of the new normal and I for one am excited to see the next advancements in Construction Progress Documentation. Jim Woody is an Associate Principal in Perkins&Will’s Washington, DC Studio. In the past decade, Jim has focused almost exclusively on the construction administration of healthcare facilities in this region. He provides technical oversight of the design and construction documents and will lead the construction phase for projects. Jim becomes an integral part of our internal team during the design phases so he understands the ‘why’ behind planning decisions and can ensure those are carried through in the field.",

    "content": "Have you requested or shared a computational design script/workflow with a colleague recently? Did it work right away? Chances are that at least some hiccups occurred. Sometimes I share scripts with myself and get them. Now, we all want to deliver more efficient and sustainable buildings, we want it so hard that we plug wires, write code, and do all sorts of automation so that we answer important questions regarding energy, daylight, wind, carbon, etc. Well, not everyone is excited about wires and scripting, and they are right. But, we still need to make sure everyone reflects on the environment and be efficient. The following research article is a summary of my thesis as MSc. Architectural Engineer from the Technical University of Denmark. It aims at scaling computational design workflows by delegating their use to cloud computers that don’t sleep, have coffee breaks and get stuck in meetings, while designers can access these workflows without the hassle of looking at wires or calling IT for installing plugins on very specific versions.  This responsibility stays solely with the folks who actually like doing this sort of work (like me 🤓 and other nerds I know across the firm). Here we go… Computational Design (CD) is around for many years now. Its adoption is still increasing in #AEC (Caetano, et. al 2021). Not so recent, yet very relevant sources (Davis , 2011) already pointed to the fragility of parametric models, and its development issues. CD usage in #AEC is diverse (De Boisseu, 2022). Some use it to enhance modelling productivity (parameteric), or to generate solutions (generative), others just as conceptual sandbox (algorithmic). Common ground is that everyone write some sort of procedural computation (script). From a practical point of view, large firms deploy specialist teams to apply CD in architectural/engineering projects. Smaller firms without enough resources have individuals who are particularly interested and find a way to sneak CD in their workflow. These teams/individuals are a scarce resource.  Keough and Hauck (2017) shed a light in this issue. Specially if #AEC as an industry want to leverage CD into more projects. They mention a finite consulting problem. They also suggest using #cloudcomputing to scale things. At Perkins&Will and Schmidt Hammer Lassen (Copenhagen) and which supported this project, a library of CD workflows (mostly Grasshopper, Dynamo scripts) it’s been harvest, but it’s really hard to deploy them into projects. Here’s 4 issues I highlight: Only a limited group of people is able to use workflows. Workflows are not self-contained and often need to be reengineered from project to project. Execution of workflows is tightly coupled with the developer local machine The whole process is serial (and hard to parallelize). Enough talking about problems. It’s not like I discovered anything new really. In fact, many parties are already trying to address them. This is the case of Hypar and Pollination Cloud . They are cloud platforms that execute workflows. I reviewed Hypar, Pollination but also 3 other workflow systems that are not #AEC related. They are Argo Workflows , Apache Airflow and Luigi . They all help orchestrate and execute tasks. There’s also a whole world of workflow management systems. Essentially they are applications to assist the orchestration and execution of workflows. These systems have frameworks and common features. They usually have components like: UI, data and metadata management, execution engine, schedulers, container resource manager, monitoring and API. At some point I realized there was close to nothing in the literature pointing to how Hypar o r Pollination Cloud were designed, what assumptions they took and just general discussion. So I tried to help. I review these systems based on documentation or open-source code available and usage. I do the same with Argo, Luigi and Airflow. In fact Luigi/Argo are part of the Pollination stack. So I try to design a framework based on those systems, that can orchestrate CD workflows. I will describe what considerations I made: The usage and the development of CD workflows are decoupled. The CDner develops, encapsulates and deploy its workflow, and the system exposes it to who ever wants to use it. The system uses containers to encapsulate and schedule workflows. I find it more extensible, since this opens the framework to whatever programming language a CDner want to use (Python, JS, C#, etc.). The UI doesn’t expose any code complexity, but rather is used to “fill the gaps” in the workflow blueprint. Meaning it can be simple for people who are not CD experts. There should be mechanisms to store persistent data, workflow definitions, and to pass data between workflow tasks. Data is passed either as parameters or artifacts (files). The system orchestrate the workflows/task. There are different ways to do it. Pollination/Airflow/Luigi parses code using a DSL. Hypar generates boilerplate code after you manually choose parameters/dependencies. Argo uses a manifest. I think they are all great 😊. I use “solution objects” to match parts of the framework with the issues we talked early: Reusability Encapsulation Extensibility Composability I test the framework with a small experiment. No way I could implement the whole thing by myself. So I pick some GH @ladybug_tools sample scripts, wrap them using Rhino Compute, dockerize them and deploy to a container registry. I then produce a workflow manifest that Argo reads as instructions for scheduling the containers and execute them in the right way I need. Unfortunately, I had to skip implementing a meaningful UI as the framework suggests. Also, I was particularly interested on the orchestration and executions. A few conclusions: The framework decouples usage from development of CD workflows. Therefore increasing reusability to more projects then currently supported. Encapsulation is important. In order to be executed, a workflow needs to be self contained (external dependencies included e.g.) Cloud resources can expose an infrastructure otherwise unavailable for comp. designers operating on their local machines. Workflow management systems can help orchestrate, trigger, schedule and execute these workflows. It’s smart to either adopt or adapt them to #AEC usecases. Some future work I foresee: Encapsulation has similarities with process mining for #digitaltwins . They will soon evolve to more dynamic rather then static representations. The two roles: the workflow coder and the user. I see those as two essential parts. While the coder takes the responsibility of encoding, the user is the one who compose the workflows in something meaningful. Containers, cloud computing is another layer of complexity for architects and civil engineers to digest. It’s not rocket science, but it’s not simple either. That’s it! If you are interested in hearing more about these things or need some help deploying your current workflows to the cloud just shoot me a message 👌🚀. References: Aurelie, B. D. (2022).

We have recorded many training sessions focused on transitioning from SketchUp to Rhino, and how to efficiently deploy design workflows in this new platform. Click here to view the library. As we near the two-year anniversary of our announcement, we want to remind those still using SketchUp that you may begin to experience compatibility issues using files or plugins developed for newer versions of SketchUp. There is no roadmap for which plugins will remain compatible with Sketchup 2020. As new versions of those plugins are released some will inevitably stop working. To avoid disruptions, we will start to limit which plugins can interact with Sketchup, beginning this July with Enscape.

    "content": "Introduction The last decade has seen a change in how projects are staffed, managed, and led. Through the use of file transfer protocol (“FTP”) sites and cloud storage services, project teams are no longer tied to a single physical location. Today, it is more common to have a design team comprised of members from offices across multiple states working together on one project. This is especially true on projects of scale. The old but reliable way of communicating the construction progress was through field reports and digital photographs, transmitted via e-mail or posted to FTP sites. Some of the more sophisticated clients and contractors used webcams where anyone at any time could log on to check the status of construction. This later evolved into web-based platforms where daily logs, photographs, observations, and deficiencies could be uploaded and shared with anyone with internet access. The purpose of this document is to share some of the technologies and strategies used over a 6-year period during the Construction Contract Administration phase of the University of Virginia (UVA), University Hospital Expansion (UHE) project. It also includes some of the technological advances explored over the past 18-months of the pandemic. The Challenge The UVA UHE project included over 440,000 square feet of new construction and 90,000 square feet of renovation. The $268M project started in 2014 with the commencement of 7 enabling projects that made way for the new, 12-story patient tower. Fortunately, the owner requested full-time, on-site representation by the Design Team. At the commencement of the 6-year Construction Contract Administration (CCA) effort, the Perkins&Will DC Office Team set themselves the challenge of experimenting with the use of technology during CCA. 360 Photos and GoPro Video Technology is constantly advancing. Moore’s law is the principle that the speed and capability of computers can be expected to double every two years4. Over the course of the UHE, we certainly saw advances in several technologies including 360 pictures and videos. Almost immediately, Skanska accepted and offered to participate in our challenge to explore the use of technology in Construction Progress documentation. Initially, they used 360 photos via a GoPro to document the weekly site progress. This later turned into 360 GoPro Videos, an example of which can be seen here: BIM 360 GoPro Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh1eza1Up9s Note while the video is hosted on YouTube, you can still interact with the video via your cursor. Simply click and rotate the image around. And to help illustrate how these types of videos can be shared with other offices, the following was a video Skanska put together to provide a virtual tour of the behavioral health unit of the Emergency Department: BIM 360 GoPro Video https://youtu.be/0pn8MXYP2yE Note this is one example of an effective way to communicate the status of construction to leadership or consultants in other offices and locations. UVA UHE Level 01 Walkthrough March 1, 2018 UVE UHE Behavioral Health Walkthrough December 14, 2018 StructionSite and OxBlue According to OxBlue’s website, they are the leading provider of professional construction camera services. On the UHE, we had three (3) webcams installed that permitted anyone with the web address to view the conditions on-site in real-time. The time-lapse video was also made possible via one of the cameras that took a photo every 15 minutes. As an additional service, OxBlue offers construction progress documentation services where they visit the site at defined intervals and photograph the project from a pre-determined set of locations. The photos are then mapped to interactive plans of the project where the user can view the photos taken during each visit. This allows the user to view the progress in a single room, for example, over the entire life of the project. Structionsite offers a similar service, except the photos can be taken by the Contractor and are linked together to provide a walkable, interactive model of the site. The following video illustrates the use of Structionsite’s ability to compare and sync 360 photos of the on-site conditions with the BIM. It also illustrates how changing the date of the photos permits the viewer to simulate “X-ray vision”, revealing what is in the walls and where. BIM Vs Actual Video https://vizlab.perkinswill.com/tours/uva/media/Bay%203%20Board%20A.mp4 StructionSite User Interface Matterport and Photogrammetry With the UVA UHE project, the Perkins&Will CA team set themselves a challenge of finding ways to use the Matterport camera during CA. The Matterport is a 6-lens camera that simultaneously creates a low-density point cloud. The camera is controlled via an app on your phone or tablet and the images are mapped to the point cloud. Each scan is connected to the previous one and the software stitches the photos together as you go. The product is a photo-realistic, walkable map of the 3D environment that can be shared via a web address. The final model can be viewed via any device with an internet connection and no special software is required. Here are some examples of how we used the Matterport and shared its output: To document a sacrificial first in-place mockup of an ICU patient room that had been constructed prior to dry-in. Being a finished mock-up that had been exposed to moisture intrusion, the room was completely rebuilt after the user signed off. Using the Matterport camera, we had a 3D, walkable model of the approved ICU room. There are a total of 84 ICU rooms on the project, so having the 3D model for comparison proved invaluable. Additionally, and because of COVID, there was a time when we thought we wouldn’t be able to get final photographs of the rooms. Our photographer was able to generate final photos from the Matterport model. To document the full-scale, off-site performance and visual mockup of the exterior. We have since used this model in presentations about the project at various conferences. To document the on-site conditions just prior to turn over of the plinth (Ground thru level 2M). This model was shared with the users, who in turn shared that they used it for training purposes in getting the staff familiar with the new layout. We also shared it with the 1st year med students, with whom we facilitated a VR Workshop on the project. Experimentally, to document the post-demo conditions of one phase of the renovation. We used Matterport’s ability to generate floor and ceiling plans to compare the post-demo conditions against the as-built drawings. Using the new iPhone app, we used it to document the existing conditions for an add-service and shared the model with the consultants to help inform their proposal relative to the very limited scope. The MEP consultant was based out of Boston, so this helped tremendously during the Pandemic. Additionally, we can’t tell you how many times we have pulled up a model on a phone at a conference and/or marketing event. It is a fantastic conversation starter. Consider that the Matterport camera we used on the UVA project is only the 2nd generation. Now imagine where this technology will be in 5 years! In our opinion, it is an amazing tool that everyone should be familiar with and be able to talk about its capabilities with existing and future clients.",

The Rhino update can be done relatively quickly depending on if you are in the studio or at home.   One thing of note is that this update will require a restart of your laptop within 10 minutes of the process in order to complete the installation.   Please take note of those so as not to do it while you are on an MS Teams call or have other time-sensitive work happening on your laptop.   You will also see this message in the dialog prompt when you confirm you want to run the installer.   This update will be required next week if you have been deferring the installation. In addition, there are also required Revit hotfix updates for 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 .   These hotfixes help with some issues Revit may see as it relates to BIM360 where we store all of our project models. Each of these is required on a day next week so you will be forced to install them all next week if you haven’t already.   One thing to note is, because of how Autodesk builds these installers the install process for Revit 2019 and 2020 can be extremely slow even with good broadband speeds.   Expect it to take many hours for those two, so it is recommended to run the updates at the end of your workday. You will also see the newest version of Lumion available in software center, updates to the Revit IFC exporter , Rhino Inside Revit add-in, Autodesk license manager, InternetClicker , Climate Studio , and Vray for Rhino and Vray for 3dsMax, and updates to Autodesk Desktop Connector .   All of these are available al la carte as you need them for your current project responsibilities.   Also next week we will be making all the titles that come with Adobe 2022 available for everyone across the firm. When application updates are required for something you already have installed the pop-up may show up on your laptop at an inopportune time that wouldn’t allow you to run the update right then.   We cannot control that timing as it has to do with how windows functions and all laptops check into the server at random times, however, you can always defer that pop-up and then open software center at any time that is convenient for your work to select the update being prompted and install it on your own schedule.",

Our Miami, Toronto, and Denver studios presented case studies showcasing this collaboration in our most recent Design Forum. If you missed it you can see the recording here. Contact Luc Deckinga, Mario Romero, or your studio’s Digital Practice representative to learn how to deploy this toolset on your current project. Presenters: Michael Blois (Toronto), Shabaan Khokhar (Toronto), Robin Ault (Denver), Pat Bosch (Miami), Damian Ponton (Miami), Ashley Stoner (Los Angeles), Luc Deckinga (San Francisco) Bonus! To further promote this effort and synthesize the knowledge that we collected through this collaboration Zahner has produced a whitepaper that explains it succintly. Download [52.10 KB] .",

    "content": "Custom Benches Inspired by the shapes of stones on the shore of Lake Superior, the custom benches for the Crystal Court were designed as a cohesive part of the biophilic design concept. The benches needed to be large enough to define a protected seating zone in the new tree grove while meeting the weight constraints of the existing structured parking below.  Intended as an impactful element of the refreshed space, the benches were designed at three different heights for sitting, perching, and to provide armrests for those who need a higher surface to assist with mobility. Collaborative Team Developed in collaboration with a team of consultants and fabricators with expertise in industrial engineering and generative design, the benches were fabricated using a 3D printing technology not previously used in architectural and furniture applications.  The process of the printing was embraced in the layered texture of the bases. Profiles were designed based on ergonomic studies. One of the benefits of 3D printing was that all of the benches could be cohesive but completely unique in form, similar to stones on a lakeshore.  Due to the nature of production, there were no cost or schedule implications to having 20 unique shapes.  The Design Team team collaborated with graphic designer Jürg Lehni to automatically generate hundreds of potential forms from which the final plan shapes of the benches were selected. Industrial Engineer Jonathan Olivares co-designed the benches with Perkins&Will, assisting to interpret the Basis of Design and adapt it to the parameters of the 3D printing technology.  The team collaborated on several iterations of side profiles and details at material transitions. The Design Team collaborated with fabricator Dimensional Innovations, one of the only fabricators with access to a 3D printing technology normally used for aerospace prototyping.  Designs were fine-tuned in Rhino before being approved for final printing. Materiality The benches are made of durable through-color materials designed to withstand the use of a busy public space. The bases are printed using two main ingredients: a non-petroleum based PLA bio-polymer that was originally developed by a local company, and wood pulp shavings from sawmills for reinforcement. The material was formulated to be BPA-free and is considered biodegradable using industrial processes. The waste from the printing/milling process can be processed into recycled pellets and used for other purposes. The bench tops are made primarily from compressed FSC-certified or recycled paper and the product is LBC Red List approved and GREENGUARD certified. The seating zone defined by the new 3D printed benches contributes to the increased diversity of seating in the Crystal Court, providing a moment of respite in downtown Minneapolis, an opportunity for users to meet and interact, and a space that belongs to the greater public.",

    "content": "Introduction The last decade has seen a change in how projects are staffed, managed, and led. Through the use of file transfer protocol (“FTP”) sites and cloud storage services, project teams are no longer tied to a single physical location. Today, it is more common to have a design team comprised of members from offices across multiple states working together on one project. This is especially true on projects of scale. The old but reliable way of communicating the construction progress was through field reports and digital photographs, transmitted via e-mail or posted to FTP sites. Some of the more sophisticated clients and contractors used webcams where anyone at any time could log on to check the status of construction. This later evolved into web-based platforms where daily logs, photographs, observations, and deficiencies could be uploaded and shared with anyone with internet access. The purpose of this document is to share some of the technologies and strategies used over a 6-year period during the Construction Contract Administration phase of the University of Virginia (UVA), University Hospital Expansion (UHE) project. It also includes some of the technological advances explored over the past 18-months of the pandemic. The Challenge The UVA UHE project included over 440,000 square feet of new construction and 90,000 square feet of renovation. The $268M project started in 2014 with the commencement of 7 enabling projects that made way for the new, 12-story patient tower. Fortunately, the owner requested full-time, on-site representation by the Design Team. At the commencement of the 6-year Construction Contract Administration (CCA) effort, the Perkins&Will DC Office Team set themselves the challenge of experimenting with the use of technology during CCA. Virtual Reality In 1957, Morton Heilig developed a multimedia device called the “Sensorama”, which is considered to be one of the earliest Virtual Reality (VR) systems. The term “Virtual Reality” was however coined by the researcher, Jaron Lanier, in 19871. In 2010, the Oculus Rift prototype was developed, which marked the commencement of the most recent decade of VR improvements and advancements. During the Design Development and Construction Document phases of the project, Perkins&Will used the Oculus headset to facilitate self-guided tours of the new facility. The use of VR to facilitate tours of the project was so successful, we were requested to set up the device on-site for the end-users, students, and staff to tour the project. Via projector, bystanders had the opportunity to observe the user’s experience. This was later used as a means of facilitating virtual tours of the project, which worked for large groups and/or for those who would prefer not to use the headset themselves. This also proved to be a viable alternative for those who experience motion sickness. During one of the sessions, the mechanical subcontractor asked if they could use the headset to determine if there was enough clearance on the 9M level to lift an air handler from the penthouse floor to a mezzanine. This request became the impetus for us to find a way to use the VR headset to tour the Building Information Model (BIM) in 3D. “This comes at a great time. Our staff is exhausted and this will excite them in a different way.” — Sharon Hardigree, UVA ED Nurse Manager, on the use of Virtual Reality Revizto Through trial and error, Perkins&Will tested various applications and file formats to find a way to tour the BIM using a VR Headset. In the end, Revizto’s “VR immersive, collaboration anywhere” application ended up being the best solution. Since the subcontractors’ models were in different applications, file types, and formats, the Construction Manager, Skanska, used Autodesk’s Navisworks software to assemble the various models in one platform. Revizto’s software permitted us to import the Naviswork model and tour it using the Oculus headset. As a bonus, one could also tour the model using an Xbox controller. This dramatically improved the ability to tour the model when compared to mouse and keystroke. Accessing the BIM via VR opened many new opportunities for sharing the in-progress construction. It permitted us to: 1. Facilitate tours of the mechanical spaces by the facilities group prior to the completion of the project. 2. Resolve the end-users concern relative to the visibility into each of the exam rooms from a seated position at the nurse stations. 3. Confirm accessibility of above ceiling valves, junction boxes, panels, and equipment through access panels. 4. Resolve one surgeon’s concern that the specialty rooms were large enough to perform procedures. 5. Facilitate tours of the new Emergency Department by the staff and users who would ultimately occupy the space. Each of the above was completed without having to wear Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) or going through site-specific safety training. In several instances, it also saved the Team countless hours of trying to address concerns from the staff and users via meetings, drawing mark-ups, and site tours. “Incorporating VR as core to the design and development process in a Big Room environment has allowed our physicians, staff and my team to take virtual walks through the proposed design. This technology has not only equipped the team to better visualize what is being built, but has improved participation and communication bringing collaborative project delivery.” — Josh Bullock, Facilities Planner UVA Facilities Planning Capital & Development QR Codes QR code is an initialism for Quick Response code. It was originally developed in 1994 by the Japanese automotive company, Denso Wave, as a machine-readable optical label that contains information about the item to which it is attached to. In 2002, the use of QR codes became widespread in Japan due to mobile phone companies marketing the inclusion of a QR Reader3. On the UHE project, we looked for interesting ways to include QR codes in the plans as well as the built environment. Some examples include: 1. Inclusion of QR codes on floor plans linked to the interactive renderings of the space. 2. Inserted into sketches of a patient lift study to illustrate via interactive design models how an alternate lift system would impact the overall design. 3. Placed on project information boards throughout the construction site with QR codes to the project blog, webcams and interactive renderings. Note that the location of the viewer in the interactive model was based on the location of the sign, thereby allowing the viewer to compare the interactive design model against the in-progress construction.",

    "content": "We wanted to update you as we continue our CCA Modernization strategic initiative. As you may recall, our goal is to reduce the repetitive administrative work involved with the CCA process, which includes “sunsetting” the Newforma application. We initiated the plan last July with the intent to be completed by June of this year; we are now roughly halfway. During this time, many town hall-style meetings and in-depth training & planning sessions have taken place across the firm. As of last week, there were about 300 Perkins&Will team members who had engaged with the Newforma application during January, we anticipated reaching 300 active users by the end of February, so thank you to everyone for helping to manage this transition. Most tasks in January were CCA functions; however, we still have non-CCA tasks occurring, which need to be discontinued. Also, in January, we amended our agreement with Newforma, which has created an unforeseen issue and thankfully only affected two new hires and two consultants. We have a small window of time to recalibrate our licensing requirements to counter this issue during February. We are in the process of reviewing, finalizing, and reporting the remaining number of projects using the Newforma platform in our North American studios.  We are also collecting a list of the Perkins&Will employees [by name or planned resource] with CCA tasks on those projects in each studio. Any projects that will continue with CCA construction activities should be transitioning or working with your local team to plan and execute a transition to the new tools and processes.   Any project that completes all construction activities by June of 2022 should be listed and complete their tasks as they have been. Please check out our Quickstart guide for more information or reach out to someone on our CCA Modernization MS Teams channel .",

This year the focus will not be on the design tools used across firms but how we as designers can take advantage of the Data available to us and ensure we are using it in a responsible way. This virtual conference will be held of three days, starting right after Martin Luther King Day on January 18th at noon easter. The first day will be a Keynote presentation by Vernelle A.A. Noel , followed on Wednesday with a panel discussion, featuring Perkin&Will’s own Gautam Sondaram. And finishing up on Thursday with an interactive workshop, leveraging digital tools to engage the communities we design in. Registration will be available soon on the AIA national site, click here if you would like to be notified. Read on for the full brief. Architectural practice is undergoing a digital transformation while at the same time, our built environment needs to become more resilient and equitable. Technology and data will be integral to these efforts, unleashing the ability to analyze the current state and simulate the future using new human-centric measures, essentially expanding the concept of “site analysis”.  Design outcomes will be based on health, diversity, accessibility, walkability, sustainability, and other measures to effectively develop better communities. As powerful as these new tools will be, we must recognize that the underlying data can be flawed and may reinforce stereotypes or exacerbate problems like racial bias. How will we as architects train ourselves in data literacy so we do not misuse [intentionally or not] data in our work? What data is available to you and your community now, and how can you leverage it in your next project? What tools can your practice use to interact and engage within the communities you are designing, so you can hear from everyone? Join us to explore these and other questions over three days in January at the virtual AIA TAP Building Connections Congress. Tuesday January 18th to Thursday January 20th @ noon eastern",

These are two different projects for the same client: Connecticut Orthopedic Institute. Yuan Su shared Patient waiting room project and her experience of using Rhino and Revit from beginning of the project to project completion. The presentation demonstrated  how team utilized the two software tools to build the model, document the design, and assist in fabrication. Jordan Hanson and Kun Chen demonstrated use of Grasshopper and Rhino to design an organic canopy that moved throughout the project responding to different elements and conditions. This team pioneered Rhino with Grasshopper  and Revit in 2017 blazing the trail for other projects. Lincoln Jyo and Mattheus Lucchi from Brazilian Digital Practice Team presented Teçainda project where parametric facade was developed in Grasshopper. The façade consists of a series of panels that gradually angulate according to the building levels. The software allowed the designers to comprehend the relation between the visual impact of the building and its feasibility. This project is in the early design phase, and a first Grasshopper use in Brasilian office, however it promises to be a beauty!",

This month we are in the process of getting a full evaluation of all projects using Newforma in the construction phase and their timetable to either: complete construction in the next few months; or transition their work to other tools and processes. We are also identifying projects still in design stages and archiving all those Newforma projects to a read-only state. Instead of using Newforma, all projects across the firm should be using SharePoint and BIM360 to exchange files with the external project team members and filing emails in project-specific folders in Outlook. We are working with larger, long-term projects right now to set up their transition plan and new workflows outside of Newforma. We are also in the process of creating step-by-step process maps to help teams understand what to do and where to file information when we receive RFIs and submittals. If you have any specific questions please reach out to your Digital Practice team member or Technical Director for more specific directions.

    "content": "Throughout the year we faced various challenges related to sharing new knowledge and information due to the need to keep part of the team working from home. It required a new perspective of how to encourage people to watch and participate in our L&D talks. Surprisingly the response was very positive. The attendance rate was high and we were able to discuss doubts and tips from people who could add-in on the ruled topics. We aimed to level up our team’s abilities regarding tools and processes on different software. Our first training main focus was Rhino and it occurred in March. It was given by Luc and Mario and gave a good perspective of how to introduce it in our daily practices. Later in August our Digital Practice intern, Mattheus Lucchi, gave a four-session training directed to Sketchup users aiming to influence a change of software by presenting the main tools and modeling tips on Rhino. The following presentation was given by the Design Application Manager, Lincoln Jyo. The sessions introduced the BIM Manual to the team, which encourages standard practices on Revit, aiming for more efficient practice of the software and office organization. For two weeks in October, short pills of knowledge about the Quality Assurance Program were shared by Renato Siqueira. Every morning, for 10 minutes, technical information and processes were reviewed. In early November, Enscape 3.1.2 training was given by Lucas Davariz. In three sessions of half an hour, the staff could learn about the newest interface, as all main functionalities of the version. Weekly in November, two-hour sessions with 80% attendance of the staff, the Digital Application Management Continuous Education discussed relevant Revit topics, from basics to advanced, like workflows and QA standards.

    "content": "The Good News: Our NY Studio proved to be so busy, it justified the acquisition of a dozen new talented designers to come aboard and help on the various projects that needed support. We were fortunate enough to find the ideal crazy cats that fit our design appetite skillset! The Challenge: Lessons learned suggested we need these new team members to have a baseline of knowledge that complemented the bulk of the work produced on a typical project. This baseline knowledge was curated and vetted by our very own studio. The resulting syllabus was a result of those truly in the weeds and aware of the consequences when staff are ignorant to the challenges faced if these items were not taken seriously. To be clear, the goal of the training wasn’t to make these new hires especially proficient in Revit. The goal was to create a mini project that would only have them encounter the foundational pitfalls of bad ideas, when working in a team, using Revit. Proposed Solution: Spreading training sessions out (for a handful of reasons), we cover topics in a few ways. Constantly reflecting on what we should know and reviewing what we are about to learn. I speak to that sessions theme and relevance to the industry. I expand the theme and review the topics specific to each. Most topics have a description of why it has value. I do a live demo on functionality. We resource a customized exercise that everyone acts on during the session together. At the end of each session, homework is issued further complimenting the topics addressed and occasionally pushing the staff to figure things out to ensure they can troubleshoot. Each of the efforts end with querying the group as to whether there any questions or challenges. Furthermore, confirming we can move on, as the topic was ideally absorbed. Resource our summarized agenda below… Moving Forward: Those that attend the training are asked to complete a spreadsheet specific to their understanding of each topic and holding them accountable to having put the effort into learning.

    "content": "Installation Instructions below The second half of 2021 has been busy for the Enscape Custom Assets team, and we have officially rolled out the Firmwide Enscape Custom Asset Library! This library is an expansion of the current Enscape asset library with custom, curated assets from some of us passionate 3D Perkins&Will folks. At the time of writing, we have 361 assets available to you with more coming every week. Recently added assets can be visually identified by the “New” tag. The primary focus runs in parallel with our J.E.D.I. efforts by providing more diverse 3D human entourage for use in our design studies and interior renderings. Greater diversity is reflected in some of the following ways: ethnicity, cultural dress, mobility, activity, clothing style, age, etc. Secondary to this, assets may be brought in on a case by case basis where appropriate. An example of this may be a special piece of medical equipment, a police station squad car, specific furniture, etc. The PW Custom Asset Library… Is optimized for use in Enscape and will continue to expand as needed. Works in all Enscape supported programs (Revit, Rhino, Sketchup, etc.) Supports work-shared models, meaning any team member with the custom asset library setup will be able to load Enscape and see the same models that you added from the library. You can search keywords in the library such as “healthcare”, “sitting”, or “coffee”. We can always get more/specific assets as needed and if you have a special need on a project lets talk and see if its a fit for the asset library to share with the firm or a use case for that project alone. Installation instructions: Detailed instructions: Steps: Double check that Enscape is updated to the latest Perkins&Will supported version. If you are unsure ask myself or another DA to help check this. 1. Open any program that has Enscape installed and on the Enscape toolbar click the Asset Library Icon 2. In the Enscape Asset Library Dialogue window click on the “Custom Assets” tab. 3. Navigate to the bottom right corner and click the folder icon 4. Copy and paste the following network path into the dialogue prompt: S:\\_Firmwide\\Content\\Enscape 5. Assets may begin loading at this time or may take a few minutes to finish loading if you are working on a remote connection outside of the office. 6. If no assets begin loading, close out of the program, the entire program, not just Enscape. So, if in Revit close out and restart Revit. 7. The library is now installed and next time you open the “Enscape Asset Library” from the Enscape toolbar it may take a few minutes to load the assets in but this only needs to be done once per program opening. Meaning you shouldn’t have to wait unless you close and reopen Revit (or whichever program you are using) 8. Place assets as needed and enjoy! Tip: try out the search feature! (At this time Enscape does not support Category Tags or searchable tags meaning any searched word will only work if the the title of the asset contains said word, this will likely change for the better in the near future.) Please send any feedback to the Enscape Custom Assets team on Hub365.",

We collaborated with folks form HD Lab, Henning Larsen Architects and Velux on the #reADAPT project. We had 48 hours to solve the industry problem and decided to focus on reusability of building components and waste reduction during demolition. The reADAPT team won the competition for Best Overall Project! We explored the possibility of creating a database of recycled building components from a building that is to be demolished. Using a point cloud technology and parametric design process with Rhino Inside Revit we explored ways of fitting recycled components into an architect’s new design model and representing the changes in an IFC.js powered web viewer, making it easier for architects to design with recycled components!

    "content": "This month’s VizR topic is about integrating Rhino and Revit for Design and Documentation. Our first speaker is Yuan Su from our New York studio. Yuan shared two projects as case studies where design elements needed to be exported into Rhino then integrated back to Revit for documentation. Mario Romero also shared a useful tip on how to maintain the rendering assets for Enscape from Rhino to Revit to streamline model exchange between Rhino and Revit. The first project Yuan shared was a clinic’s waiting area with an organically curved partition. To optimize the curved partition for code compliance and fabrication control, the partition was exported into Rhino to be rebuilt using Grasshopper. To meet the ADA protrusion requirement for the visually impaired, she added three critical control lines, one at the base, one at 27″ and another one at 80″. Using these three curved lines, the final double curved wall was generated computationally. The script also offsets the outline and creates the wooden slats at the intervals needed, and the finished model is then transferred back into Revit using the Proving Ground’s Rhino Conveyor Tool. Once in Revit, the Curved partition was converted into a Generic Model family, where each sub-element can be mapped to a different material for rendering purposes. The 3D model was then used as part of the documentation, and the Rhino file was used by the fabricator for fabrication. By using the 3D model file, it saved the team from creating hundreds of details documenting the radius and dimension of each component. Instead, our team focused the documentation on design intent and the placement of the finished product. The finished installation came out to be exactly as we had designed and envisioned in our rendering, such that you could hardly tell the difference between our rendering and photographs of the actual built space. The second case study was an external staircase enclosure, due to the complexity of the design shape, the team needed to use Rhino and Grasshopper to recreate the model and generate the structural framing element of the cone shape for the contractors. By locating the framing element’s spot elevation and giving the fabricator the grasshopper file, the process of documentation was drastically simplified without sacrificing any design control or accuracy. Lastly, Mario Romero shared useful tips on a quick hack to recreate in Revit any Enscape asset blocks. Using his custom grasshopper script and Rhino Inside tool, he was able to help several teams recreate the Enscape assets in Revit  for Enscape visualization For more details, click here to watch the recording. Note: Starting October 2021, all VizR eXchange session has been moved to our PWU – Perkins and Will University Channel.",

We have talked about most important changes foe efficient workflows Helen Gorina gave the template overview Mark Walsh talked about Partition charts and Partition Chooser Daniel Prager explained efficiency of new casework documentation workflow Jeremy Luebker walked us through Code Compliance sheet, schedules and workflow Matt Petermann talked about Installations of 2022 software from Software Center Here are the answers to come common questions which came up during discussion: Q. My project has started is in the older version of Revit (2019, 2020). What do I do? A. If you are already in CD, you may want to keep what you have without changing the sets you already released. If you are early in the project, talk to your DA about upgrading to the current version of Revit (at least 2021) Q. I need casework with different handles(pulls). I only see the casework with no handles at all on the standard casework elevation sheet A. All casework included with the standard sheets have different types in HIVE with variations of C-pull, Thumb pulls, integrated pulls in various locations. They are highly parametric, and you can easily create unique configurations in addition to the tyles we have Here are the links to relevant resources https://mk.perkinswill.com/mk/1851/How-I-use-Firmwide-Casework-Pack-in-my-project https://mk.perkinswill.com/mk/1900/How-to-update-your-project-with-new-partition-charts-and-partitions Casework workflow recording 1: Password: “DA ” casework workflow recording2",

    "content": "For the September VizR eXchange,  Hilmar and Johan presented Arkio in a live virtual demo. Arkio is a virtual collaboration platform where designers can meet with their project team and clients to explore and design in the same space at the same time using multiple devices and platforms. As explained by Hilmar, design firms have used Arkio for design meetings, client presentations, and coordination meetings for Architectural, interior, landscape, masterplan, stage design, and game design projects. In addition to gathering and exploring with a project team in a virtual 3D space, Arkio offers designers the ability to create and add new 3D objects into the existing space using dimensional accuracy, metadata tagging, and geographical location positioning. Everyone with editing permission can participate in creating and editing solid objects in the 3D space, making it easier for participants to engage in the design process where changes can happen in real-time. In VR mode, Arkio was designed with VR users in mind, making it very natural and easy for designers to create and change their designs in 3D with minimal training. However, users without VR headsets can just as easily engage in the virtual design and editing experience using their laptop or even an iPad. The most significant improvement is the ability to import and export to Revit and Rhino models, making Arkio a viable design collaboration and exploration tool that integrates nicely into our standard design workflow.

    "content": "It is fall and as leaves change colors and temperatures get cooler we move forward with the annual release of the newest Autodesk products to stay current with the newest features and security to advance our design work.  The Digital Practice team has looked at and testing Revit 2022 and is making that available for all new projects, to begin with from the firmwide or your studio’s template. You will see it available in software center to self-install. It is a large application to install and most of you will be installing it from home so I would suggest running it at the end of the day to allow for a few hours for the download time (which may vary based on your home internet speeds) and the installation. In addition to Revit 2022 being available all other typically used Autodesk applications 2022 versions will be made available in software center. 3ds Studio Max, Navisworks, ReCap, AutoCAD LT, AutoCAD, and Vehicle Tracker can be self-installed and utilized.   All addins will be installed by you from software center on an as-needed basis so you don’t have any more or less than necessary.   You can find those that are associated with Revit 2022 through a filter in the software center interface at the top of the list of available applications. Each team should begin making plans accounting for their project schedule and external partners to find a time to upgrade. Fortunately, in BIM360 it is literally the click of a button. More importantly, is that all models for your project will need to be upgraded at the same time to continue to allow everyone functionality of linking to all necessary information from each model. All new projects should strategize to begin from the start in Revit 2022. Revit 2022 New Features This year the Autodesk development team put a big focus on making improvements to the functions and features of our primary documentation tool.   You can step through this deck to see which features our team thinks are the most likely to be used by your team and then the rest of the new features that a smaller number of people will find value in utilizing. Here is a link to the entire list Autodesk has provided, which may show you where our consultants might see value in upgrading.

    "content": "AEC Tech Hackathon Recap September 2021 A recent event held by Thornton Tomasetti CORE Studio saw people from all over the world virtually gather, form into teams and hack on innovative AEC technology solutions over a weekend in July. Hackathon judge and Digital Practice lead at the Copenhagen office Ryan Hughes recaps the event, highlighting some of the best tech and projects on show. Highlights Best Overall Hack: Spatial Scheduler A maintenance scheduling app that helps to create Augmented Reality (AR) enabled spatial persistent notes on locations in the real world. Taking home the overall win, the Spatial Scheduler team made use of a nice little package called Placenote (in the above video) to leave persistent AR notes in the real world – meaning that using a simple AR-enabled device, one user could leave a 3D tag on an element in, for example, a building site, sync it up to a drawing set, and let someone else come along and find it in the future. This could be useful during construction or post-occupancy maintanence, for example. While they hadn’t developed much in terms of core technology, the robustness, quality of presentation and potential for applications snagged them the win. Team: Elcin Ertugrul, CORE Studio – Amit Nambiar, CORE Studio – Adam Chernick, SHop Architects – Rolanda Villena, Thornton Tomasetti / Ezgi Sendil, Graduate Student Best Open-Source Hack: Bonobo A Grasshopper bridge for Blender simulations. Working on a completely open-source code base, the Bobobo team impressed the jury by building a realtime link to Blender, enabling the use of advanced features like particle simulations, mesh modelling tools, all of the cool features of a community-based subdivision-based modelling suite. Given the increasing maturity of Blender BIM tools, this could be an interesting project to develop on or watch, allowing a potentially well-featured BIM workflow beyond Rhino and back. Team: Sergey Pigach, CORE Studio – Omid Farshadfar, CORE Studio – Congzheng Zou, BIMtech – Ardeshir Aliaskari, Freelancer – Sahil Tadwalkar, Insite VR Ryan’s Choice: Hackuble A generative 3D modeling environment built to write and execute C# code in the browser. Falling just short of an actual award, and receiving something much less glorious instead – the status of my favourite project of the weekend, the Hackuble team made use of a really exciting technology called Blazor. It’s been around for a while. Based on ASP.NET, Blazor allows you to import, write, compile and run C# assemblies and code in an otherwise web / Javascript-based environment. This means that effort put into .NET libraries for Revit or Rhino could be reused by web-native applications such as Compute. Team: Emil Poulsen, CORE Studio – Hanshen Sun, CORE Studio – Praneet Mathur, ARPM Design and Research – Yankun Yang, iBuilt Group – Yushi Kato, Turner & Townsend Notable Project: Recenseo A PDF Markup tool dedicated to Rhino that allows a list of PDF drawing markups to be directly referenced into a 3D Rhino model. Arguably the simplest yet most immediately useful project was Recenseo – a tool developed by a team from CORE Studio and Structure Craft for marking up and directly referencing PDF drawings into Rhino. Team: Nick Mundell, CORE Studio – Amit Nambiar, CORE Studio – Mark Skepasts, Structure Craft – Johan Reissmuller, Structure Craft – Lukas Fuhrimann, Structure Craft – Sahar Barzani, Structure Craft Judges Nicholas Desbiens, KPF Andy Watts, Grimshaw Martha Tsigkari, Foster & Partners Pablo Zamorano, Heatherwick Ryan Hughes, Schmidt Hammer Lassen Robert Yori, EnTech Engineering PC Workshops The event kicked off with two days of workshops on Thursday, July 8th, and Friday, July 9th. Recording of the workshops can be found on their YouTube channel . Attendees had the opportunity to take part in, amongst others, the following workshops: Interop Cubed | Grimshaw Architects The workshop will focus on interoperability and data visualization among AEC platforms. Leveraging the power of Rhino.Inside and Unity Reflect, participants will get the opportunity to learn how to query, modify and analyze Revit elements in Rhino using Grasshopper and explore potential ways of transferring, communicating, and visualizing environmental analysis data of their designs in an immersive Unity enabled VR environment. Rhino.Compute API | KPF The studio-based culture of design offices gives designers the freedom to approach design problems in a variety of ways. The challenge of solving these complex problems has led to an increase in specialist groups within the office, specifically experts in computation, urban analytics, and environmental performance, who are working alongside several project teams at once to improve workflows and design outcomes. Recent efforts to centralize computational tools through workflows such as Rhino.Compute and hops look to increase the number of projects that benefit from specialist knowledge, while at the same time increasing the impact of solutions developed within the context of a specific project. Using Rhino.Compute as a back-end solver for Grasshopper definitions, design studios can centralize and version control definitions while offloading heavy workloads onto remote hardware and providing end-users with a UI/UX set in their existing workflows. This workshop will review how to link a Python Script running in Jupyter Notebook to a Rhino Compute Windows Server to facilitate quick analysis and heavy computational workflows better. Rhino and BIM Interoperability | MKS BEAM BEAM extends the current Rhino and BIM interoperability workflow providing easy-to-use apps to organize data and geometry directly in Rhino, managing and simplifying the transfer to Revit or IFC. During the workshop participants will learn how to: Create Families with Parameters and manage BIM data in Rhino. Importing a Family in Revit, Advanced Revit workflows with Rhino Blocks and Adaptive Components. Automation with visual programming with BEAM for Grasshopper and BEAM for Dynamo. Workflows from Revit To Rhino. Rhino IFC data and export. Symposium On Monday, July 12 the event finished strong with a series of presentations by industry innovators in Architecture, Engineering, and Software development. Each presenter showcased how advances in technology and work culture are shifting the way projects are designed, developed, and delivered and spoke about the future trends in the industry they see emerging. You can find presentation descriptions below and watch the event at their YouTube channel . Grimshaw | Shifting Focus: Design Technology at Grimshaw Andy Watts, Director of Design Technology / Georgios Tsakiridis, London Computational Design Manager ShapeDiver | New Collaboration Workflows Based on Remote Parametric Algorithms Mathieu Huard | Head of Product & Co-Founder KPF | Distributed Design Intelligence: Broadening the Impact of Specialist Knowledge Cobus Bothma, Director / Luc Wilson, Director / Nicholas Desbiens, Head of Digital Practice McNeel | Peeking over the Horizon Scott Davidson, Business Development / Luis Fraguada, McNeel Thornton Tomasetti | Custom Toolkit Development for a Complex Façade EOR Project Alloy Kemp, Senior Associate / Viktoria Henriksson, Project Engineer Virtual Social Spaces As I am sure any of you who have previously attended a hackathon will attest to, the social takeaways of a weekend are some of the most valuable. Whether it’s discussions about projects and tech, networking, or just to have someone to work late into the night with, the common spaces are some of the most active of the event. This particular hackathon, given its virtual nature, presented quite a logistical challenge in providing this aspect to the participants, but the team at Thornton Tomasetti found a novel solution – to provide exactly this sort of space online through the use of SpatialChat.

    "content": "Leveraging Real Data for Realtime Visualization Presented by Michael Vollrath Visualization tools such as Unreal are often disconnected from the real world and require manual configuration to set up a simulation based on real-world data. Michael Vollrath set out to build a simple tool to simplify data connection between virtual and the real world and enabling easy access to the real-world data to drive virtual world simulation. The first example is a widget that retrieves real world data by simply entering an address, pulling weather and daylighting data from an open source web API, Once the data is retrieved, one can use it to drive the rendering environment, to create the exact weather, day lighting, and sun location. Further expanding the capabilities of creating interactive experience, Michael demonstrated how one can embed custom interaction with elements within a 3D space, like adding an operable light switch, trigger short animation to demonstrate a folding table etc. All these interactivity can enhance our virtual experience within the 3D space. Other gadgets can be created to perform view point analysis for a building, and using section views to create simple 2D or 3d plan that clearly shows different views visibility through windows.

    "content": "Our Quarterly Core eXchange brought a new format in sharing of knowledge through a panel discussion focused on data and the biased and unbiased use of it to help solve design problems. The term “data equity” captures a complex and multi-faceted set of ideas. It refers to the consideration, through an equity lens, of the ways in which data is collected, analyzed, interpreted, and distributed. It underscores marginalized communities’ unequal opportunities to access data and, at times, their harm from data’s misuse. It raises the issue of data sovereignty and the democratization of data.  Data equity pushes us to consider the ways that data can reinforce stereotypes, exacerbate problems like racial bias, or otherwise undermine social justice. This panel got together and talked about how can we use data to represent every group in our society.   What we should look for to question our data and find out how or if it might be biased in any way.   Take a look at the recording if you were unable to catch it live and engage in this conversation that will continue to impact the design profession in more significant ways in the future. “Most data sets are biased.   Everyone has their own preconceived notions……….Teams working on these data models need to be more diverse in order to see things others on the team might not see.”  – Serra Uzun “looking at the data by the numbers and come up with these bold statements that we feel are going to be transformational for our clients……..how does this [data] impact our practice” – Gautam Sundaram [We need people that are] “becoming more literate at taking large data sets and doing something with them, making sense of them.”  – Jason Diamond “Ask yourself ‘what might my biases be?’ when looking at your data” – Brad Rogers",

The client was in a “mad panic”  to move to the building they have selected, and the team took creative approach and used cutting edge digital tools to make it possible. The project was started in 2018, when new design tools like virtual reality became readily available, and the team took full advantage of them in their design process and communication with client which turned out to be critical in speeding up the sign off process. Building programming The team took blank canvas approach and incorporated brand design for each of seven brands in arrival areas and key areas on the floor Typical for each brand floor : Individual band design: arrival area and screens on the floor Typical joinery, different finishes.

    "content": "The Software Games: Present This (commercial) Oh boy… We might just have hosted the most glorious Software Games yet! We saw the “remote worker” as an opportunity, not a challenge. So, hold on tight, I am compelled to want to get into the weeds on this one. This past year has triggered Digital Practice to rethink engagement. Whether communicating internally or externally, how do we successfully engage?!? #ZoomFatigue Of all the tools and workflows showcased over the year, the design technology leaders in Perkins&Will’s northeast region settled on OBS, MIRO and Spatial Composer to be the real potential game changers. Each tools having varying levels of adoption in the local studios, we decided a solid way to promote their existences and purposes would be via… That’s right, another installment of The Software Games. This one would be titled “Present This!” Let’s address the obvious challenge of a cross studio software games event… As mentioned initially, it was this challenge that became the foundation for this event. We used OBS to replace everyone’s webcam with their display. The result, instead of seeing the 6 faces of that rounds competitors, we saw 6 live feeds of their desktops. As they cycled from one website to the next or toggled onto their desktop to launch photoshop, the audience was able to see all this live (refer to images below). “Working together as a team was the best part about the competition, but the Miro-to-Spatial Composer workflow was extremely innovative and easy to follow. using such interactive platforms felt like opening a door to a new world of storytelling and presentations” Onyi Egbochue OBS has been used by the firm as a method to engage our clients differently. Whether interacting with one’s shared screen or showcasing multiple webcams and a PowerPoint in custom layout such that it compliments a presentation, OBS has proven to remove all limitations. Often intimidated by a completely new application, we asked those staff members wishing to play to merely install the application and load in a template that allowed them to share their display versus their webcam. A small, but delightful, step in the right direction. The rest of the event was almost butter in comparison. MIRO has arguably dominated the firm as a method of storyboarding. Vetted by Digital Practice, we believe this platform has the most pros over cons when it comes to online collaborating. How to define MIROs value… Oversimplified, I would say it’s Pinterest meets Mindmapping meets Slack/Teams meets virtual pull planning meets… I don’t know… other helpful apps. It’s all online and can be accessed by anyone (without a membership). The only element MIRO lacks when it comes to communication, is a polished method of showcasing the result. Welcome Spatial Composer. Unlike OBS and MIRO, this tool is specific to Perkins&Will. That’s right, it was developed in house by our i/o team. No better way to stand out then with our own in-house custom presentation tool. Tailored to our own internal needs/demands, our i/o group built this online platform. Cate for an oversimplified overview of the tool? You got it… Think google earth meets PowerPoint meets Prezi. Our mission defined (showcased in the above tools), we were only lacking objectives and an overall goal… Easy peasy. To keep it simple and open to interpretation, we decided the theme was “resilience.” We emphasized to the teams; this was open to interpretation (the sillier the response the better). After all, the objectives had less to do with the theme and more to do with the utilization of the tools. “The software games was a great way to introduce miro, spatial composer, and obs to people who haven’t really used the programs before – in a fun, fast-paced, friendly competition. it was great to see cross office participation and get to know some people from other offices as well!” Elaine Zhang Round 1 & 2 Graphic (via MIRO) Click to view actual MIRO Board used for the games! Round 3 & 4 Graphic Each round ended with a popular vote (handled via an online poll hosted by Menti). An overall poll was issued to the audience, but the judges had their own input that allotted points. View the recorded event! “It was fun watching teams create interesting story lines on the fly and you could see everyone genuinely trying their best to do their part for their team” Nengi Njere Time to acknowledge the winners!!! The 2021 Software Games WINNERS!!!! Future events are inevitable. Is your studio up to the challenge?",

    "content": "SF Client Engagement Toolkit Presented by Patrick Bayer Patrick Bayer has been developing a Client Engagement Visualization Toolkit for the San Francisco office. The purpose of the toolkit is to help the SF studio establish consistent architectural graphics and define its studio presentation style. The toolkit is currently in the draft phase and consists of a menu reference for quality visualization, the available resources, and time and requirements to produce each level of visualization. The second half of the VizR call was dedicated to an open discussion to engage visualization experts around the firm and to share existing resources around entourage, material libraries, and such so that they can be harvested and pulled into a resources section for the toolkit. The toolkit introduces 7 tiers of presentation style from early concept sketches to fully rendered images. Each tier offers visual examples, descriptions, and purpose of using the style, common mistakes, and time and material resource information. Patrick welcomes all comments and suggestions on how the toolkit can be further improved. Click HERE to watch the recording.",

    "content": "Throughout this past year, the pandemic has forced processes to go virtual to enable the ongoing advancement of work and ideas.  Since the nature of our work involves a team of individuals, we have adapted to technologies, tools, and platforms that facilitate the necessary communication required to produce the quality we did when we were all in the office together.  Our clients also have similar goals and desires but don’t always know the path to get there. Like many of our clients, University of Chicago Medicine holds large project meetings with designers, consultants, clients, stakeholders, etc. with everyone in the room in order to discuss and document important decisions on a project early on.  These will guide the life of the design efforts and ultimately the functionality of the building.  This was done with plans, renderings, and diagrams pinned up on the walls and participants putting up sticky notes, and facilitators documenting everything.  All this was done to use lean methodology to advance the design problem-solving process and move the project along. With online collaboration platforms like Miro , facilitating these meetings can be (in some ways) better than it was in person and continue to bring all the stakeholders together into an inclusive virtual space.  As a service, we have provided UCM the education and resources to take these Kaizen or continuous improvement events and go digital.  We were able to show them how Kaizen could be done virtually through Miro in conjunction with zoom.  This was done by templating their existing process on a board through preset cards, processes, virtual tours, and other in-person events that take place during an in-person Kaizen event.  We supplemented all of these templates with training playbooks for the facilitators, participants, and consultants.  In addition, some hands-on training for all UCM facilitators is planned to give them the confidence to run these events virtually.  UCM like other clients sees the need for a future hybrid approach even as more people are getting back together face to face.   This condensed digital version is much better than the 40 photos you took of the conference room with the in-person meeting.  This will only enhance and improve their kaizen process to continue to make the event lean and raise the process to hopefully raise the design that comes from the group effort involved.  In the end, the client is very impressed at our innovative use of technology’s seamless integration with our expertise and ideas which also provided us plenty of client engagement as we pursue their next big building expansion on campus.   If you think this type of engagement approach might be effective with your client reach out to Matt Petermann or Nick Cameron to get more details of how to be a trusted advisor to our clients through these digital consulting services. Templated Miro Frames to increase facilitator consistency and proficiency for their Kaizen events Using Digital Wayfinding to direct participants around a board just as if you would do the same in a conference space. Organizing the board to match the agenda and activities participants will collaborate on.",

    "content": "PROBLEM Over the winter of 2021 we were tasked with performing a building assessment for two campuses in Delaware, DSU (Delaware State University) and Wesley College in an effort to build the foundation for a Campus Master Plan that would show us the volume and condition of available spaces with the ultimate goal of combining the two campuses under one umbrella.  After a good deal of asking around, we found that our tools for such a task were limited or straight up lacking. TASK The goal was to assess the condition of 49 buildings at DSU over the course of three days, and another 32 buildings/facilities at Wesley College over the course of another three days.  Even though these are high-level assessments that is still a monumental task to take on in such a compressed time frame.  We found that there were two apps that would aid us in this effort: PlanGrid and FastField.  There are other puchlist/field report apps that could also fill this purpose.  Both allowed us to work remotely throughout the day and upload results and findings when wifi or cellular signal was made available once again.  With three people, each carrying an iPad and their mobile phone we were able to canvas each campus in the time allotted and provide our colleagues back in the office with results and information in short order. PROCESS With the scanned plans, sections, and elevations provided by both facility departments, we uploaded the available content to PlanGrid creating a filter for each building.  This allowed each team member to focus in on a specific building without scanning through hundreds of sheets to orient themselves.  On each floor plan, we tagged photos taken with the app to indicate where we had taken the pic from.  In a number of instances, teammates used their phones to acquire better pics than the iPad was able to produce under low light levels or wide-angle lenses.  These photos were also tagged back into the PlanGrid app to maintain the consistency of the information that would be given to the rest of the campus planning team and eventually to DSU as part of the final document.  Once all the buildings were photographed and documented we exported a photos report that shows the overall floor plate where each photo tag was placed which was then followed by individual plan snippets and the associated photos for each location.  This proved useful for our colleagues who were unable to visit the campuses and gave them a good idea of the cross-section of available spaces and their potential. The FastField app was chosen for its flexibility in the creation of the survey, ability to work remotely, and the ways that it could be posted to the group once completed and submitted.  FastField allows you to customize your survey to cater to your needs such as: Written descriptions Incorporating photos Yes / No responses Setting up radio buttons to click one option under the established category. Setting up radio buttons to click all options that apply to a category. Scale ratings of various conditions.  For example, you could apply a scale of 1 to 5 of the building’s condition, sustainability practice, utilization for social interaction, or whether the building is even worth repurposing or being demolished. The administrator can also update the survey form in real-time and dispatch it to all or specific team members or post a completely different survey to the applicable staff. Due to the limited timeframe, the team decided to blanket the campuses and photograph all that we could, and then once we returned to our respective home offices use FastField to assess each building and facility while running through the volumes of pics taken.  Once that was completed the app allowed you to post that survey in various formats such as Excel, PDF, XML, etc. and forward it to specific teammates, or upload it to an FTP, send it to Dropbox, Send Files to SharePoint, etc..  For our efforts, we decided to export to Excel and copy each building report into a master excel file that would give us a greater overview of all the buildings in one location. SOLUTION This was the first time we had used these tools in this fashion, so the process was not perfect but was effective and adaptable for an on-site team of three people.  One of the challenges that may be worth noting was the limited and inconsistent data, plans, and documents provided by the university hampered and limited the effectiveness of the photo reports and surveys of a number of buildings.  Still, our documentation of each building permitted us to build a report, post site visit, in FastField within 30 minutes or less per building. The utilization of the PlanGrid and FastField was truly helpful in bringing the rest of the campus planning team up to speed on the existing conditions and the use of both campuses.  The cumulative excel file that brought together all the assessment reports was then filtered down into a matrix that will help the DSU leadership to begin to understand what they have at their fingertips, what buildings can be repurposed, and begin to refocus their funds and efforts toward building and strengthening the programs provided by the university.",

    "content": "Design Presentations: Florida International University Validating Facilities Requirements During Design, Not in the Field Presented by Damian Ponton, Miami office One of our Miami Studio’s most important clients, Florida International University always looks to Perkins and Will to deliver innovative solutions. As part of their new BIM Standards, FIU requires the design team to engage with their facilities group. The intent is to make sure that their needs are met and addressed during the design phase, not in the field. Bypassing the traditional page flip, the team decided to invite facilities to walk inside the model, evaluate MEP equipment arrangement and clearances in real time. This required a tight coordination of the Revit model for the engineers. Using this approach, facilities was able to get a real feel for what the unbuilt spaces would be like and provide important feedback on what worked and didn’t work, avoiding costly construction re-work in the field by catching critical issues now. The client’s requirements included ensuring access for proper maintenance on building systems Team takes new approach coordination with engineers Client’s virtual walkthough CHoP Updates Children’s Hospital Of Pennsylvania computational design with adaptive components was presented earlier,  here are the links: https://digitalpractice.perkinswill.com/2019/08/09/computational-design-case-study-chop/ Dahmahlee Lawrence from New York Studio gave and update from the construction site: If it fits, it ships!

    "content": "Easy Virtual Galleries for Everyone Presented by Mario Romero, Justin Benjamin, and Andrea Manzano For the past few months, Digital Practice and Vizlab have been collaborating together to create a workflow and template for design teams to easily create their own online virtual galleries. We’ll walk through a few of the projects that have successfully used this new form of client engagement as well as talk about how you can quickly get started with your own! In the era of non-stop virtual meetings, how can you enhance your virtual presentation to make your presentation the one your clients will remember? By using the Virtual Gallery, we transform the simple 2D presentation into a rich and immersive 3D experience that one can walk through virtually and enjoy the presentation much like visiting a real gallery. Our Virtual Gallery solution creates a website that is lightweight and browser-based and is easily accessible to everyone. Using our pre-set Virtual Gallery template, the team can easily set up their project’s virtual gallery using their own content. The virtual gallery can host all kinds of content such as images, videos, 3D models, links, and QR Codes. The Gallery is designed with a nonagon center space attached to 9 separate wings, each wing is 30′ wide by 80′ long and can host eight large boards, four boards on each side of the wall. All the project team has to do is provide the image content for the boards by exporting the slides from your PowerPoint or InDesign presentation. Our experts then insert these images onto the boards and render out your 3D virtual gallery. With the help of our VizLab, we then upload the gallery into your own project website! For more information on how to set up your own virtual gallery, please visit the Digital Practice- Virtual Gallery Quickstart guide . Click HERE to view the recording.",

Check out the recording for a full walkthrough. Download the Grasshopper script here LEED Logic Achieve a direct line of sight to the outdoors via vision glazing for 75% of all regularly occupied floor area. Additionally, 75% of all regularly occupied floor area must have at least two of the following four kinds of views: Multiple lines of sight to vision glazing in different directions at least 90 degrees apart Views that include at least two of the following (A) flora, fauna, or sky (B) movement (C) objects at least 25 feet from the exterior of the glazing Unobstructed views located within the distance of three times the head height of the vision glazing; (NotImplemented) views with a view factor of 3 or greater as defined in “windows and offices; a study of office worker performance and the indoor environment“ The complete LEED requirements can be found here: https://www.usgbc.org/credits/new-construction-commercial-interiors-schools-new-construction-retail-new-construction-ret-2 Geometric Elements Rhino elements for the building (Floor, glazing, opaque) are used in all three analyses. The external goal objects for the second analysis (flora, fauna, sky, motion, distant objects) are modeled as well. The rhino elements are referenced into nodes so they can be used in the grasshopper script. Floor surfaces are subdivided into an analysis grid. The tighter the grid the more accurate the analysis, but the longer the analysis will take. Check LEED requirements regarding the analysis variables. The main analysis is performed by a Ladybug component called ViewPercent. The Grasshopper Script The View Type parameter creates a different pattern of rays, which represent the lines of sight from each analysis grid zone. 0 – Horizontal 2 – Spherical 3 – Sky Exposure The results of the view analysis are output as a Matrix. Combine that with a Dispatch node to get only the unobstructed vectors. Converting all the goal objects to a single mesh and then using the MeshRay node and the same dispatch trick as last time gives us the successful vectors. The final step of the script combines all the separate analyses into a single score and a colored visualization of the analysis grid.",

    "content": "For our April VizR eXchange, Emre Aslan presented an interactive Virtual Gallery that was built using Unreal Engine, the gallery was automated with an Artificial Guide (think Siri in your model) that walks you through the exhibition space and narrates the displays as you walk around the gallery. The use of Unreal Engine enables you to create a virtual model that has a much higher quality of lighting, rendering, and material mapping. The main advantage of using Unreal is the ability to create a much more photorealistic virtual space and the potential to embed static and dynamic media files, such as images, PowerPoint, videos, and animation. With the ability to add custom interactivity, the model can present different design options with a simple click of a button to switch the virtual scene into another design option.  However, the downside of it is the enormous file size Unreal generates, and the need for a high-performance machine for viewing and experiencing the virtual space. One possible solution is to explore the Unreal Pixel streaming service to provide real-time cloud-based content distribution. Using the streaming service, the model can be shared with a much wider audience through the use of a browser on any internet device with minimal graphic capabilities. The exhibition space is designed with sensors that will trigger events, such as voice narration or animations. The event will only start as you walk close to the display and will end as you walk away from it. Emre also added different interactivity samples such as moving objects and drawing on panels. Some panels are movable, allowing viewers to interact with the panels to rearrange the display. Other panels can spin and rotate as you approach it or touch it. One main model even does an exploding axon as you walk up to it, and reconstructs itself as you walk away from it. (see image above).

    "content": "Digital Practice Core eXchange and Training Library Resources From April 13th to the 22nd, Digital Practice team members and other experts from around the firm completed another round of classes for our quarterly Digital Practice Core eXchange.  These continuing education sessions are designed to give our staff awareness and understanding of the tools and processes available to us at Perkins&Will. This quarter we started off with a featured keynote speaker, Randy Deutsch.   He is an architect and professor at the University of Illinois.  This was broadcast through the firm’s Vimeo account publicly on our website.  Randy covered many technology topics from career paths as they pertain to an evolving technology landscape to how AI is impacting the design profession.  Everyone was able to join the live sessions through Teams from wherever they are currently working and engage with the speakers to gain a better understanding in order to improve their work process. These live sessions were spread out over Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday for two consecutive weeks on our Practice Lecture Hall Teams channel for continuing education. If you weren’t able to make a session live or want to review one, you can find the recording in our ever-growing exchange library. If you are having trouble finding a recording in our library use the filters at the top of the thumbnails to narrow it down by category If you have any suggestions on topics we should cover or ways you think that this event could be more successful and valuable, please reach out to Matt Petermann on Teams. The sessions are categorized by topics and you can view the recording and a slide deck and also connect with presenters for a follow-up discussion We had many highly attended classes and engaging question and answer sessions with those attending.   Some new ones that are relevant to working from home are a couple of new topics around the hands-on how-to for the Miro platform, an introduction to data visualization using Microsoft PowerBI, and also a session on how to navigate the requests for BIMs and where we are heading as a firm. Overall this quarter’s exchange had just over 1400 total attendees for the 17 sessions and keynote.",

    "content": "For our March eXchange, Scott Schroeder presented the work in progress James Brown Arena project’s visualization. Using the new Visual Dataprep tools, Scott was able to import geometry from Revit/Rhino into Unreal Engine to create photorealistic rendering and animations. Scott started the presentation with a tip on how they used a model within a model for the Vanderbilt Project. Using a linked scaled-down model, one can take the viewer into the model at the reduced scale of the model and give the viewer a chance to walk around and experience the buildings as if they are inside the model. The main topic of the presentation is how Unreal was used to create real-time visualization of the massive James Brown Arena project. Scott walked us through the steps of using Data Prep to bring in the model from Revit into the Unreal Engine, and offered best practices in how to set up the lighting and scenery in generating photo-realistic renderings and animations. One of the questions that are often asked is why do you use Unreal vs. other software such as Enscape, Lumion, or Twinmotion. Scott answers this question by showing and panning in real-time a landscape scenery that is filled with vegetation, and explains that the strength of Unreal is in its ability to render complex scenes with a large number of complex vegetation or crowd in real-time. https://digitalpractice.perkinswill.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Unreal_landscape.mp4 and the clip below of the James Brown Arena demonstrates this clearly, as it would be impossible to achieve this level of visualization without using Unreal. https://digitalpractice.perkinswill.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/arena.mp4 For more details about the presentation click HERE to watch the recording.",

    "content": "Title slide, original background image: sergeytyapkin.com/ As architects, we spend a large amount of our time creating shared digital environments with the aim of one day affecting the real world through an ancient technique – construction. We wondered if we could learn something from an industry that focus entirely on creating convincing, immersive, artificial environments – video games. Hosted by the Technical University of Dublin, we spent a day in February questioning conventional modelling paradigms together with students from their Architecture & Technology unit. We introduced alternative concepts for modelling architectural space whereby the design intent is shifted to the design of a modular spatial system. A specific algorithm is adopted from the games development industry and applied in the context of an existing tower structure in Dublin city center. Wave Function Collapse, explained on github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse Wave Function Collapse (WFC) is a special approach to constraint solving as a process of elimination. Each grid location holds an array of binary values for what tiles it could or could not be. During the observation phase, one tile is selected and given a single random solution from the remaining possibilities. This choice is then propagated throughout the grid, eliminating adjacent possibilities that don’t match the input model – the wave collapses. The final feature is backtracking. If an observation & propagation result in an unsolvable contradiction, they’re reverted and a different observation is attempted. The technique is traditionally used to create infinite, procedural cities in games or movies. Because a designer has defined the style, connection rules and geometry, the algorithm can reconfigure the individual modules to create unique, convincing landscape segments, endlessly. We extend the original 3D implementation by discourse.mcneel.com/u/Alasdair The students were invited to design spatial voxels that form the input to the WFC algorithm, which resolves their distribution in the tower. The results are then analyzed and displayed in the viewport under a variety of lenses – type distribution, solar access, views and daylight were a few of the parameters. Previous Previous Previous Next Next Next 1 2 3 Here, the architect becomes the curator of candidate proposals, that, while technically and logically correct, may not display spatial or environmental attributes quite in line with the designers ambitions. While algorithmic approaches may be a long way away from reliably outputting anything remotely close to what we would consider a natural solution to a design problem, we might start to ask ourselves if they can get us close enough.

    "content": "Of all the new features available in Rhino 7, Rhino.Inside will have the greatest impact, especially for users who work in Revit. If you’ve never used Rhino or Grasshopper before it may be intimidating. Here is brief description of how the three work together followed by workflows for first time users to send geometry both directions between Rhino and Revit. For more information about Rhino 7 and Rhino.Inside check out last month’s Computational Design eXchange call . Rhino.Inside: What is it? Rhino.Inside breaks down the barriers between designing in Rhino and documenting in Revit. Without getting too technical, Revit, Rhino and Grasshopper are all running in the same ‘session’, which means the data in one is available to all others.  Open a Revit file. Open a Rhino file. Pass geometry and data back and forth using Grasshopper. We no longer need to export/import through a third-party file format and lose data in the translation. How Do I Use It? We will have a one-click install for Rhino.Inside available soon in the software center. Until then download the latest Rhino.Inside build here . Close Rhino and Revit before installing, then restart Revit. OPEN REVIT FIRST! Rhino.Inside (and Grasshopper) must be launched from within Revit to connect the two environments. If you accidentally open Rhino separately the Rhino.Inside tools and menus will not appear in Grasshopper. Open Revit, Add-ins tab Rhino button Rhino Tab Grasshopper button Revit tab in Grasshopper What Can It Do? There are many ways to interact with your Revit and Rhino objects using Rhino.Inside. The first step is to select elements to operate on. Next, decide what you want to do with them. In this example, we are selecting all Revit elements of a single category (Floors). All floors (2) in Revit are passed out of the node. The yellow panel in the middle shows those elements (Revit Floor : Concrete). Every aspect of the Revit elements are available to be used or modified, including parameter values. In this example, we are simply extracting the element geometry (Closed Brep). Grasshopper holds data within nodes that are connected together to form a script. To make geometry available natively in Rhino or Revit it must be ‘baked’ into Rhino or put in Revit using ‘DirectShape’. Both functions are very simple to perform. See the image below. The Revit to Rhino process is shown in blue; Rhino to Revit in red. There is much more that Rhino.Inside can do. We’re still exploring all of the options but wanted to get these basic workflows out to everyone and encourage you to explore more on your own.

    "content": "The Union West Hospital is a major Perkins&Will project located outside of Charlotte, North Carolina. Multiple Perkins&Will Studios across the US (Dallas, Charlotte, and Durham) are working collaboratively to deliver a state-of-the-art hospital to serve the North Carolina area. Construction began in April during the start of the COVID-19 Pandemic, although the pandemic was a major speed bump in the process, the team was able to utilize the technology available to keep the project moving forward efficiently and effectively. One of the most valuable ways the team achieved this was by working with the Contractor to build a functional Mockup of the Patient Room with the Nurses Station. Once the mockup was completed, a local team member was sent to scan the mockup using a Pro2 3D Camera. Given the inherent size of mockups, it only took a couple of hours to scan and upload for viewing. Once the scan was uploaded, it was distributed to Perkins&Will project team members for review and comment. Project members were able to virtually ‘walk’ the site in the comfort (and safety) of their home. Throughout the process of Construction Administration, the project team has shared the link of the scan with Brasfield & Gorrie (Contractor), Atrium Health (Owner),  WMBA and NBBJ (Partner Architects), and the Division of Health Service Regulation (DHSR). Each group used the scan in different ways and to date, the scan has 1230 impressions and 770 visits since August 11, 2020. A Mockup is a valuable tool for the Contractor and Architect as a way to ensure Quality Control. During the CA phase, there have been multiple virtual meetings using the scan to walk through and discuss defects, issues, finishes, lighting, etc. Because the 3D Scan Link was so accessible and convenient the mockup was used and talked about more frequently than a traditional ‘on-site’ mockup. It even created conversations earlier in the CA process like means and methods and contractor/sub-contractor scope.  This process also allowed us to share the link so more people can see and visualize the space, which especially helped the younger staff going through CA and understanding the overall coordination of the design. Finally, this process has helped us with design and CA creating a new perspective without being physically there while also saving time and money without having to travel. The Scan was sent to DHSR as part of their initial review of the Patient Room and Nurses Station – The adjacencies and design will be the new standard for Atrium, Code officials were able to review the layout of handrail locations and review corridor requirements. The scan was also used in conjunction with the drawings to help visualize and ‘place’ the officials in the space. The Mockup Scan was most effective in use with Atrium Health, Firstly they were impressed with the technology and Perkins&Will’s initiative to document and share the 3D scan. Secondly, The scan was distributed to decision-makers around the Hospital System and is being used in a Regional Conference presentation showing the new standard of their Interior Design. The Matterport scan essentially paid for itself in time, money, errors, and (hopefully) helped us win more work by showing that Perkins&Will has the latest technology available and is able to maximize its potential.

The project is located in the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco and consists of academic space and 656 student beds. This talk focused on the design and evolution of its distinctive fluted panel façade, a detail that echoes the image of the classical fluted columns so commonly associated with historic courthouses. What began as a precast concrete facade evolved into a unitized system clad with extruded aluminum to create the distinctive shapes. The team worked with the Building Technology Lab to test the concept in full-sized CNC milled mockups. Nathan Mattson and team from Los Angeles office presented Camp Lakota project – winner of  the AIA Los Angeles Merit Award in the highly competitive unbuilt category. This projects of a girl scout camp is an example of a land stewardship and “light touch” design where Perkins&Will led the team of consultants to fulfill a beautiful, environmentally friendly, and highly functional vision. Listening to this presentation I not only admired the design as a professional, but wanted to turn time back and have an opportunity to experience the Camp Lakota as a camper. Tools We  focused on new version of HIVE Content management system, how it is different and similar to the old HIVE, discussed efficient searching, and shared a roadmap for future enhancements. More HIVE training will be coming in April, as part of our quarterly Digital Practice eXchange sessions",

    "content": "The London studio is doubling down on its commitment to delivering all interiors projects as Net Zero embodied carbon by 2030. Ensuring our design team have the right tools and that we are working hard to improve the performance of our supply partners are at the foundation of our manifesto. A collaboration in London between Workplace Strategy, Digital Practice, Sustainability, and Corporate Interiors has created ‘Now’ our database for capturing material and products, manufacturers sustainability data, and information.  The submissions are collated and scored by our Sustainability team allowing our designers access to a searchable measured database on the most sustainable materials and products to use on our projects. The database captures information on healthy materials, recycled and recyclable content, supply chain diversity, and circular design principles amongst others. The team developed a survey/questionnaire using Qualtrics and pushed supplier responses to a simple searchable excel database.  This database is stored on the London Team Net Zero channel for all to use.  While this product is in its infancy, If successful, it is hoped, it can be rolled out to more studios globally and developed into a more sophisticated and interactive online database system with the goal and overtime to become a public resource to complement our Transparency site. The system was beta-tested to a small selection of suppliers in December, soft-launched in January, and has been launched to the industry NOW!",

    "content": "For our February eXchange, Dan Creekmore from our Viz Lab presented the latest tools and services in creating 360 Panorama experiences. Panorama images are 360-degree images either captured from a 360 camera or rendered using various rendering software, such as Enscape, Rhino, 3DSMax, Vray, and Lumion. A 360 Panorama tour, is basically a series of 360 images sequenced together to give the viewer a google street view experience, where one can hop from one point to another within the viewer. With the unfortunate demise of Roundme and Ptp tools, new tools such as Kuula.co and Pano2VR are replacing them to be the preferred tools in creating 360 pano tours. Kuula.co offers web-based 360 pano tours, it has a simple interface in creating the tours, and are able to add hotspot links to other 360 images, as well as additional information such as images, documents, videos, and URL links. If you need to deliver the 360 tour as a product for the client to host, or for offline viewing, Pano2VR would be a good tool to use. Pano2VR is a powerful tool that gives you options to further customize the 360 experience with all the bells and whistles you need. Lastly, there is Object2VR, which a quick tool to create an interactive experience in viewing a 3D model using a sequence of 2D images. Finally, one can recreate the Virtual Gallery experience using these tools in order to share the immersive experience online with the clients and consultants, without requiring them to download any heavy Enscape files. They only need to click on the link to the virtual Gallery website, and start exploring the Gallery using their internet Browser. To learn more details, watch the recording HERE , and feel free to contact Daniel Creekmore at our Dallas Viz Lab.",

    "content": "At the start of our Work from Home adventure, the Digital Practice team worked with several pilot projects to find a way to virtually recreate our Pull Planning sessions.  In the past, Pull Planning was conducted as half-day workshops in our conference rooms using premade task cards developed by our Technical Design Community.  During the workshop, design partners would pin these laminated milestones on the wall according to when they should occur in the project timeline.  Once the preliminary schedule was on the wall, the participants would discuss sequencing and deliverables to create a lean path towards the deliverables.  These meetings had been very helpful for our teams, and we did not want the hybrid work environment to stop this progress. Physical Pull Planning – A mixture of premade cards and custom cards Utilizing Tasks by Planner, a product within our existing Microsoft Office 365 suite, we were able to replicate the process of pinning laminated cards with tasks cards in a digital environment.  Our three templates (SD, DD, and CD) are prepopulated with the milestone cards from our physical decks.  Using this digital method we were able to expand on the physical cards and allow each task to have assigned responsible parties, added checklists, tracked task completion, embedded Living Design links, and more. Premade CD cards in our Pull Planning Templates Going Virtual also gave us greater control of the workshop.  Instead of our design teams taking the better part of their morning to prepopulate all the major deliverables and deadlines on a pinup wall, our teams have ample time to vet deadlines, presentations, and required info exchanges beforehand.  Additionally, we can invite the design partners into the Planner environment a week in advance, allowing everybody to set their tasks prior to the workshop starting.  This prework lets the workshop become a discussion of everyone’s process and needs, without the time lost with crowding a pin-up space. Using the Tasks by Planner interface to move Tasks from Week to Week This method of Virtual Pull Planning has been presented at the last two Digital Practice Core eXchanges, which are available to watch on the Digital Practice website .  Additionally, the Technical Design Community now has access to the presentations developed for our pilot projects.  The Pull Planning Step by Step presentation covers both the setup and goals of Pull Planning for our design teams, while the Consultant Onboarding Presentation is meant as a takeaway boot camp for any consultants wanting to participate in the Virtual Pull Plan.  We have developed Pull Planning Templates that can be used on any project for Schematic, Design Development, and Construction Documentation phases.

    "content": "New HIVE CMS (content management system) is finally here! It is available to Install from Software Center Why HIVE CMS? The main reason for the update is that new HIVE CMS operates independently of Revit and cannot possibly crash it . In other words, if something goes wrong with HIVE, you can kill it in Task Manager, and continue to work in Revit without risk of losing your work. This is especially important in time of WFH, when the home connectivity is not as good as connectivity in the office. It is still Revit agnostic and will associate itself with the active Revit session. Search algorithm is working significantly faster, and there are multiple improvements to the user interface and functionality. Revit version compatibility the old HIVE is not available for Revit 2021 and will be retired in April New HIVE CMS works for versions 2019-2021 amd will remain operational in the future versions of Revit Content Database all 2019-2020 content was migrated from old HIVE to the new HIVE CMS and is available now 2021 versions of the content are also published We will keep 3 active versions of content in the future, and new version of Revit rolls out, the old content will be retired Training and question new HIVE CMS interface is similar to the old HIVE, with some improvements we will introduce new HIVE CMS on February 11 Design and Delivery call, and then follow up with mK cards and other training materials",

    "content": "Digital Practice Core eXchange and Training Library Resources From January 12th to the 21st, Digital Practice team members and other experts from around the firm completed another round of classes for our quarterly Digital Practice Core eXchange.  These continuing education sessions are designed to give our staff awareness and understanding of the tools and processes available to us at Perkins&Will. This quarter we had many new topics, as well as updating and improving many other topics from previous core exchanges.  Everyone was able to join the live sessions through Teams from wherever they are currently working and engage with the speakers to gain a better understanding in order to improve their work process. These live sessions were spread out over Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday for two consecutive weeks on our Practice Lecture Hall Teams channel for continuing education. If you weren’t able to make a session live or want to review one, you can find the recording in our ever-growing exchange library. If you have any suggestions on topics we should cover or ways you think that this event could be more successful and valuable, please reach out to Matt Petermann on Teams. The sessions are categorized by topics and you can view the recording and a slide deck and also connect with presenters for a follow-up discussion We had many highly attended classes and engaging question and answer sessions with those attending.   Some new ones that are relevant to working from home are a couple of new topics around the hands-on how-to for the Miro platform, an introduction to data visualization using Microsoft PowerBI, and also a session on how to navigate the requests for BIMs and where we are heading as a firm. Overall this quarter’s exchange had just over 1800 total attendees for the 18 sessions.   We also had two health safety and welfare accredited courses in the mix of all the accredited sessions.   Next quarter we are looking to add accreditation for ASLA and IDCEC to see if these courses can cover more professional’s continuing education requirements.",

Tools and Workflows Second part of the call was dedicated to a relatively new tool which has great potential to make your workflows better. Shawn Zirbes from CTC Software has introduces us to CTC Occupant Flow Analyzer. It enables a Revit user to generate occupancy loads, define egress paths, and visualize paths. This tool works over multiple levels. It builds the egress paths around the furniture. WE already have this tool on your CTC palette, and on top of that, developers are commited to help us throug a pilot project and make the tool work best for us",

Building upon their efforts with Health Former (campus wide covid surge tracking application for Swedish in Seattle), the team created a working prototype for a mobile application which enables users to quickly survey rooms and spaces for critical assets. Aimed at healthcare workers who need a simple interface to contribute data spatially referenced to our project models, the application leveraged the Design Automation api (among others) to populate Revit models and our proprietary database with asset data and proxy geometry. Click HERE to learn more about the Asset Tracker project. “Candy Cane” Accelerator Just before the holidays, Autodesk accepted a small team of developers to participate in a virtual accelerator focused on Internet of Things (IoT), data. Driven by Dasher360 and researchers at Autodesk, new Forge Viewer extensions enable point cloud data visualization in the Forge Viewer including connectivity to cloud based IoT data services from Azure and AWS. With a variety of experiments in IoT sensor data for spatial tracking active throughout our organizations, especially those based on human activity and behavioral tracking using computer vision, our efforts focused on body tracking and data sets/interactivity which ultimately pushed the limits of the new Autodesk services. Beneficial feedback for AutoCAD, married with effective insight and education into how to more deeply customize the Forge Viewer for our team. Both Autodesk sponsored events provided training and technical support that has been helpful in the ongoing development of an automated, scalable web based dashboard and project data visualization framework. Collaboration between I/O and Digital Practice has brought the Forge and Bim360 services together with add-ons for Revit and modern web development tools for a foundation which can leverage our push to comprehensive Bim360 project usage. In early 2021 the prototype dashboard development team will lead a workshop and training session to establish the long term roadmap for the project and expand development efforts modularly.",

    "content": "For our December VizR call, we have two exciting project presentations. DLC Winning Team Arroyo – Vangel Kukov and Hala El Khorazaty discussed their winning design and their insight of participating in the DLC competition. URMC – Kaitlin Knotts shared the award winning design for URMC while taking the audience on a virtual walk through. Hala El Khorazaty and Vangel Kukov shared their design process from site selection, concept design, to modeling and rendering the project using Lumion. With only two days to work on the DLC competition, the team decided early on to use Lumion which enabled them to spend more time on the research and design portion of the project, and less on the presentation side. With the use of Lumion, they were able to quickly put together the final presentation complete with landscaping, entourage, rendering and graphic styling with minimal efforts. For more information on the project visit the project DLC page (https://dlc.perkinswill.com/portfolio/arroyo/) Click HERE To watch the recording of the presentation (00:00 – 21:00) University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC) – Presented by Kaitlin Knotts URMC is an adaptive reuse project based at a former Sears location in a Mall renovation. By opening the new orthopedic clinic in a suburban mall, life and economic activity are brought back into the mall community. The project team used Enscape as a design tool throughout the entire process. Enscape was especially helpful when presenting to the client and guiding them through specific design features. Using real time fly-bys and walk throughs, the team was able to demonstrate design features such as the large canopy and entrance waiting areas, and how the space worked as the customers approach the facility for pickup and drop off. Instead of just using still rendering and floor plans, the team used live Enscape model and walked the client through the design space, to demonstrate how the design features helped in orienting patients and breaking down long monotonous corridors into light filled pleasant space. Kaitlin did a fantastic job at presenting the project while navigating the model live for our audience. Click HERE To watch the recording of the presentation (21:00 – 55:00)",

    "content": "Snippets is a collection of Grasshopper tools developed at Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects, with the intent of making computational design accessible to all. The tools are collected in a custom toolbar, making it easy for everyone to get access. Snippets aim to enhance the design process in three ways; 1. Automating existing, repetitive tasks – e.g. calculating areas or test fitting facade layouts on a massing model. 2. Enabling new design workflows and processes – e.g. generating urban massing, terrain, or complex geometries. 3. Augmenting design decision making, by providing continuous access to relevant data and documentation as an integrated part of working on designs in Rhino. This includes daylighting, visibility, parking requirements, etc. Enabling Collaboration and Sharing At SHL, we want to help facilitate collaboration by providing a way for us to share the benefits of our collective work. Many studios invest their own time automating complex or repetitive tasks. Sharing this work between studios or even employees locally has historically been difficult, which has inevitably entailed an unnecessary duplication of efforts. Therefore, we have developed a template and method that allows you to easily save your scripts in a format that can be added to our custom toolbar. This template, based on our years of collaboration in computational design, includes guidelines on how to layout your script and suggestions as to what to make visible to the end-user. We hope that this template will foster sharing and reuse amongst the computational designers at Perkins&Will, giving us access to a huge, consistent library of tools and an edge over our competitors. Installation instructions You can find the latest version of Snippets and installation instructions in this folder: S:\\_Firmwide\\Rhino-Grasshopper\\SNIPPETS Notes 1. Many of the Snippets have been developed to answer the requirements of specific projects, which means they have been tested on real-life scenarios and then refined to meet changing demands. 2. When completing a project, a good rule of thumb is that you will need to spend an extra 20% of your time to turn the raw grasshopper script into an easily accessible tool. 3. “Designing” the Snippet greatly influences the attractiveness and usability of the tool for those who are not experienced Grasshopper users. Even for experienced users, immediately knowing the purpose and value of a tool will influence the degree to which it is used. Snippets have helped us to optimize and augment our design process at SHL significantly – and we are just getting started! We hope that you will join us, share your ideas, and help us to deliver differently across Perkins&Will. View Digital Practice Core Exchange Presentation Video",

Adam Hamilton (Minneapolis DA) demonstrated two Dynamo scripts which intelligently automate common Revit workflows. EnlargeElevatePlace This script automates creation of enlarged plans with elevations and places them on the sheet. It even places a callout around multiple selected rooms, and allows the user to select view templates for plans and elevations, elevation symbol, and a destination sheet. Real time saver and consistency champion! CADtoWalls Another Dynamo script shows the power of collaboration in Perkins&Will is CADtoWall. It was started by Jacob Werner from Boston office. Adam in collaboration with Jacob resolved many challenges. The script allows to intelligently convert CAD file to Revit walls. Not a trivial task… It even recognizes and works around wall hosted elements like doors and windows and can create walls from curves. This script it gets you 80% from CAD file to real Revit walls, and Jacob with Adam are still perfecting and optimizing it, so get the latest version from them when you need to work on this task Perkins&Will Details Database Another great example of collaboration is a searchable online database of Perkins&Will details. This site collects drawings from past Perkins&Will Revit projects and delivers them in an online, searchable database. You can test drive it at Core.Aiprentice.com. It is now open to everyone at Perkins&Will! This site is the result of a close collaboration over the past year between the Digital Practice team and AiPrentice, a software developer. Our Technical Directors have taken the last few months to test drive the site and provide their input into how it can be used and how it should be developed. To add your office projects to the database, contact your office DA or Luc Deckinga (Digital Practice team). Please give it a spin and help steer this work in the right direction by sharing your ideas and comments! Below  one of possible workflows",

    "content": "Successful Project Pursuits using Virtual Galleries Presented by Alejandro Branger, Lorena Knezevic, and Damian Ponton In the Covid-19 Pandemic times, the need for social distancing has presented new challenges in project pursuits. How does a team maintain client engagement in virtual presentations and manage to stand out in an era of countless Zoom meetings? Alejandro Branger, Lorena Knezevic and Damian Ponton demonstrated how they created a virtual gallery to host a recent project pursuit for a new engineering and computing building at FIU. Members of the Florida International University selection committee were guided through a virtual gallery of wall mounted presentation boards, scale architectural models and wind and daylight analysis models all in real-time. This strategy proved to be effective and ultimately led to a critical project win for the team. The team wanted to create a more immersive experience than watching PowerPoint slides for their pitch, and decided to design a custom gallery where they can plan out the sequence of presentation, and layout all the visuals along the walls and in the space of the gallery, then virtually walk the client through the presentation inside this virtual gallery. The gallery space was built in Rhino, and rendered using Enscape, and presentation materials included 2D drawings and renderings that were brought into the gallery space and mounted on the walls as Decals. 3D design and analytical models were placed throughout the gallery space so they can showcase and walk around the models as they present and discuss the project design and analysis. Unlike using pre-canned animation, the real-time Enscape walk through provides the team the ability to jump around to different display in the space as needed,  to stop at a model and discuss specific topic when asked about it,  and thus making the presentation more engaging and memorable to the client.

This quarter we had many new topics, as well as updating and improving many other topics from previous core exchanges.  Everyone was able to join the live sessions through Teams from wherever they are currently working and engage with the speakers to gain a better understanding in order to improve their work process. These live sessions were spread out over Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday for two consecutive weeks on our Teams channel for continuing education. If you weren’t able to make a session live or want to review one, you can find the recording in our ever-growing exchange library All sessions were registered for continuing education credits for you to meet your professional requirements through the AIA.  If you are part of another organization where you need continuing education units for your professional license you can typically self-report these classes but check with your organization for specific details.   The only limit is that you have to attend the classes live to gain course credit. The sessions are categorized by topics and you can view the recording and a slide deck and also connect with presenters for a follow-up discussion https://digitalpractice.perkinswill.com/digital-practice-exchange/#exchange-library We had many highly attended classes and engaging question and answer sessions with those attending.   Some new ones that are relevant to working from home are a couple of new topics around virtual engagement that looked further into the features of the Miro platform, and also a session on Bluebeam tips and tricks that had a big crowd in attendance. Overall this quarter’s exchange had just under 1800 total attendees for the 18 sessions which pushed our total attendance over the last year to just shy of 9000 employees attending a specific class over the 108 classes we have provided to the firm.",

    "content": "Over the past few weeks, a small team has been working on how we can enhance our storytelling and showcase our innovation while presenting to clients via Teams, Zoom etc. We have found that folks in general struggle with the limitations of Microsoft Teams and Zoom functionality, and clients struggle with not being able to interpersonally connect with our team via the small Microsoft Teams or Zoom tiles. The big idea is to have the ability to control the virtual stage , similar to how we choregraph our movements when presenting to clients face-to-face. Our goals are 1)to control the size of the speaker image and enable rapid transition from one speaker to the next, 2) include more interactive events in presentations, such as “live sketching”, virtual model tours, and more, 3) create a easy to deploy audio/video kit of parts. Overall, we want Perkins&Will’s presentations to be innovatively presented, consistent with the quality of design and creativity our teams deliver once selected. To help resolve this, we have been collaborating with a production team who produce live/streaming events. Suffice to say, they are experts, and we have teamed up with them to craft a heightened experience. We have “battle” tested this technology twice, first for the firm wide Biennale Awards [below] and now with a mock interview which included an LA based Design team, with Zena Howard, Casey Jones & Gina Brendt as clients. Take a look at the final video below, and scrub through the timeline, there has been no post editing to this video, this was all done live in the interview. We now have the technology and process to include this type of presentation for our pursuit teams. For complex interviews we will need to continue utilizing the outside production team and depending on the complexities, the cost can vary. At the same time, we are developing inhouse resources so less complex meetings or events can be produced internally. To facilitate the enhanced nature of these productions we have also developed a new concept we call “Studio on a Stick” . This concept consists of everything you would need to capture high quality audio and video from remote locations as well as from home. The kit is designed to be easily delivered through mail and the lights are battery powered so it can be used in remote locations, such as onsite, a model shop or with other interesting backdrops. Email me if you have any comments or would like to discuss any upcoming pursuits.",

    "content": "A look at creating a high-quality presence in our virtual engagements through both analogue and digital tools. If we can’t present our best selves in person, we can present the highest quality video and audio virtually. Light is your friend A rguably the most important factor to influence a high-quality video experience is light. Simply put, the more light available, the better small digital sensors will handle your video. Whether it’s your internal webcam, a high-quality external webcam or a high-quality glass lens on a DLSR – light matters. For my studio, I am situated in a small home office that has a floor to ceiling window. While I knew that window would provide great natural light, I also knew it would provide inconsistency throughout the day. Flat in the morning, and bright in the afternoon. I opted to install a fairly simple three-point lighting setup in my studio. And rather than use tripods which I would trip over every day, I installed ceiling mounts to hang the lights permanently. The premise with a three-point lighting setup is to have: a key light (the key source of light, typically brightest and closest to you – left side of my face), a fill light (the light to balance the key, typically less bright and further away – right side of my face), a hair light (a light situated behind my head, which provides a visual pop from my backdrop). This three-point light setup is tried and true and used in many studio photography and videography setups. And, with the right products, and location placement, are not bright in your eyes and are not hot to touch. Many people have asked me about ring lights or stand / webcam lights. I tend to shy away from them, as the actual light quality and impact is quite minimal, as well – they are terribly uncomfortable to look at. In a pinch these solutions are ok, but not preferable for extended periods of time. What’s been so positive in having the three-point lighting setup, is no matter the time of day, my light is always consistent. And, with my floor to ceiling window, I can also choose to combine natural light with my overhead lights to changeup the visual appearance. I can control shadows, evenness, and other effects if desired. Your Camera Matters We all have different equipment. Some laptop webcams are more than sufficient, and some, are not. Having a high-quality camera provides you the opportunity not only to up-the-quality (resolution, sharpness and contrast), but also to have access to more comprehensive apps to control those settings. I opted go external with a Logitech Webcam. I change the settings almost daily, from zoom to exposure, brightness to saturation. An external webcam can be incredibly versatile and with a strong lighting setup, can be equally powerful. As the old saying goes, “The best camera is the one you have with you.” This saying holds true when also speaking about webcams. The firm has access to an application you can install called iVcam, this app can turn your iPhone into a high resolution webcam. Sounding Good! One of the things I realized early in WFH was the importance of good audio. We’ve all been in meetings where you couldn’t hear your colleague, or your client could hear you, or you can hear the trash truck picking up at your partner’s house. The importance of audio is paramount, possibly even more so than video. Not all microphones are created equal. Our laptop and webcam mics are typically omnidirectional, meaning, they pickup sound from everywhere. The baby crying, the dog drinking water – or, even more incriminating, your typing (aka “multitasking”). I opted to increase the quality of my setup with a cardioid microphone, which by design picks up sound from the front and a little from the sides, but inherently not from the rear. It’s designed for vocal singing, or like what we do all day effectively – podcasts. You can buy USB cardioid mics, or XLR in the event you have a more robust mixer and digital audio interface. In addition to the audio quality which comes from our microphones – it’s equally important to hear each other well. Along those lines, our internal laptop speakers typically make it a challenge over the course of our 8-hour days to really hear well. External speakers are an easy way to dramatically improve your setup, and also, when combined with a more sophisticated digital audio interface can yield tremendous experiences to have our calls. Of course, we all have access to combination mic / headphones – but who likes wearing these all day every day? Where can I download that Backdrop? I can’t tell you how many times I get asked this question. And, my answer is always the same – it’s either “my wall”, or “my fabric”. All analogue, all the time. Rarely do I use a digital backdrop. Since my wife and daughter wouldn’t agree to me repainting my wall with charcoal grey, I retain the purple wall which was once the staple backdrop to a vibrant playroom for our daughter. Purple is nice. It changes tone throughout the day, in fact in the evening, it’s indiscernibly dark with my lighting setup. I prefer to have a plain color backdrop. I could’ve added my personality to this by including my books, my drawings, artwork, etc., but I’ve chosen my online presence to be minimal. I also opted to purchase foldable backdrops. I bought a chroma key green as well as a white backdrop. I use the green screen when I need to key out my backdrop (for dynamic or still backdrops, zoom interviews or OBS broadcasts). I use the white backdrop when I want a more welcoming “pop”. And, I can change them by the hour, or by the day. Backdrops are an easy way to change things up and make a big impact. Like Photography – the better your glass is, the better quality your photos will yield. Like Audio Recording – the better your microphones and preamps, the better quality your audio recording will be. With WFH and having an online presence, I’m more excited about our analogue presence and the quality it delivers. Better in, better out. Products and Resources Lighting This video is the most comprehensive overview on three-point lighting. There are many LED lights on the market, a few we like are GVM LED lights for multiple uses at home or the studio especially with these ceiling mounts . For adjustable and powerful light For a portable solution Camera The Logitec Brio is the camera to get, but has had supply chain challenges due to Covid . Why not use your iphone ? You can, click here and ask for an iVCam install. Microphone / Speakers BlueMic make some amazing microphones including this one , and probably best in class Yeti Nano . In conjunction with a mixer and digital audio interface, professional podcasting can be achieved. Some folks have asked about lapel mics – can also be a great addition and allow you to take the pesky airpods out of your ears. This one is a good one , and can be used with your laptop or iphone . If you have a upcoming interview and need equipment, please reach out to Nick Cameron and Al Anderson",

    "content": "Suzhou Science + Technology Museum – Weaving a Complex Facade Design Investigation Exploring the Weaving Pattern The Suzhou Science + Technology Museum project began as a design competition entry that emphasized the region’s historical use of silk for textiles through a fluid form with a “woven” facade pattern. Upon winning the competition, the challenge began with how to technically achieve this woven facade pattern in a rational manner. One of the first challenges was finding a way to simplify the doubly curved surface into fairly regular panel sizes to reduce the amount of unique panels required for fabrication. Grasshopper was used as the tool to both rationalize this surface and quickly test different facade patterns that could invoke the “weaving” notion. Project Area Ciric + Cultural Office Chicago Project Suzhou Science + Technology Museum Team Ralph Johnson Thomas Mozina Marius Ronnett Aashit Shah Danny Mui Neil Rendel Ryan Fagre Tools Rhino Grasshopper Download Workflow 1 Above – Each color represents a unique panel size 2 After these initial studies, it became clear the client desired the facade to look closer to the competition entry of weaving panels. We took a step back and re-evaluated how we might be able to break down the facade in a rational way that could also achieve this look. This led us to investigating how we could take a simple grid and create a tessellated pattern within that grid. 3 In the end, we were able to achieve a weaving facade pattern with around 10 unique panels. With this logic established, the final test for us was to have a mock-up created to ensure that this design could be achievable.",

    "content": "Getting the Most from the Matterport Platform For our October VizR eXchange, Dan Creekmore, Director of Perkins&Will’s VizLab, presented an overview of Matterport along with project team examples using Matterport from around the firm. Followed by a short Architectural Photography 101 tips. Using Matterport platform, one can capture 3D spaces and makes it easy to share it as an immersive experience, very much like the Google street view but for interior spaces . There are many ways to capture the 3D space into Matterport, one is not limited to using only the Matterport Pro device. In fact, you can even capture using an iphone device using Matterport app. Matterport can be used for existing condition survey and project site progress reports. The resulting images are not only navigable like the Google street view, you can even take measurement and get close up view of the space. One can create a custom virtual tour that is easily shareable with client and consultants, this is especially helpful during Pandemic times where on site visits are not always possible. For the second half of the session, Dan offered some very helpful tips for Architectural Photography. On how to setup a scene, take multiple exposure HDR photographs, and how to post edit the shots to merge different exposure images to achieve the best results. View the presentation below- Matterport: 00:16 – 41:40 Architectural Photography 101: starts at 41:40",

    "content": "Let’s Talk About Pedestrian Simulation and Pathfinding Pedestrian simulation is a powerful tool that can help us better understand how people move through and use the spaces that we design. Pathfinding can help us minimize lines of access to critical points in our plans (i.e. fire stairwells). In the past these sorts of simulations were relegated to highly specialized platforms. Fortunately we’ve developed a grasshopper workflow that will allow everyone to integrate pathfinding and pedestrian simulation into their early schematic designs fairly easily and rapidly. A Few Things Before You Jump Into Pathfinding Simulation This tool is built primarily on Mouse. You will need to install it before you run the script. The Mouse plugin will be included in the download below. Install Mouse Have a Prepped Rhino Model Give the Tool a few Seconds to Run Getting Started Layer Watching: The script is setup such that it actively watches your rhino layers for the appropriate input to run so make sure to just add the required geometry types into their respective layer. Floor Surface Start Points Destination Points Settings Previous Previous Previous Next Next Next Floor Surface: Should be a single surface that mimics the floor slab minus any interior walls or inaccessible zones. Start: These are your starting points. So anywhere pedestrians would be coming into the building (elevator bays, stairs, exterior doors, etc.). These should be points . Start Points are designated by a cyan pin marker Destination: These are the desired destinations. Also should be points . Start Points are designated by a magenta dot marker Grid Size: This dictates the simulation grid size. A 1 foot grid is a pretty good balance between performance and accuracy. You can step it down to half a foot if you need more accuracy but keep in mind that it will take a little longer to run. Run Toggle: Toggling this to True will start the simulation. Do this once you’ve set the grid size. Visualizations The tool currently produces four types of diagrams: A Heat Map A Heat Graph A Simulated Route Display A Travel Distance Diagram All you need to do is print any view of the diagram you want to either an image or PDF to use it in your presentations! Heat Map Heat Graph Route Display Travel Distance Previous Previous Previous Next Next Next The Heat Map is a generated graphic that represents pedestrian foot traffic and paints the floor from Red (more foot traffic) to Blue (little to no foot traffic). Th Heat Graph is a three dimensional version of the Heat Map. The Taller the bar the more foot traffic. It’s very useful when you’re looking to visualize the data and you have solid walls. The Route Display is a very simple visualization. It simply displays all possible pedestrian paths given the Start and Destinations. The Travel Distance diagram is probably the most crucial visualization. It paints each path based on the travel distance and allows you to easily visualize the most severe or extreme cases. If you run into any problems or have any questions please feel free to hop into the Computational Design Channel and ask! You can download v1 of the script here: Download Now",

To make sure we wouldn’t have heat problems caused by a curved mirror inside the Bell Museum we simulated the sun position over an entire year to find out if any areas will become perceptibly warmer because of concentrated reflections? Will a shiny roof blind the neighbors? An analysis was run to find which days and times the sun would reflect off of a proposed Galvalume roof and onto the neighboring building. Project Area CCC Office Minneapolis Project Bell Museum Team Luc Deckinga Tools Rhino Grasshopper Download Workflow Solar Reflection Analysis 1 (Interior) A 3D grid of voxels (that’s fancy talk for ‘boxes’) is built on the walkway next to the wall. Sun rays are projected against the mirror and reflected back through the voxel grid. Voxels turn a warmer color as more rays go through them. Green areas in the above images have no concentrated heat effect, increasing to yellow, and eventually red. The center image (Curved in 1 Direction) is representative of our actual condition in the Bell Museum, confirming the inhabitants are safe from spontaneous combustion. Diagrams below show areas that would receive concentrated reflections off of a surface that is: Flat, Curved in 1 direction, Curved in 2 directions Solar Radiation Analysis 2 (Exterior) Investigation: We used the same sun simulation method to discover if we will hit the apartment building on the adjacent site with sunlight reflected off of the shiny Galvalume roof. Result: All reflections onto the apartment building occur before 9 am, which the design team determined is acceptable.

    "content": "Throughout this pandemic period, the way we collaborate has drastically changed.  Since the nature of our work involves a team of individuals, we have adapted to technologies, tools, and platforms that facilitate the necessary communication required to produce the quality we did when we were all in the office together.  We have done this successfully through virtual meetings and leveraging cloud resources like BIM360 and Sharepoint. Remember (pre-pandemic) those large project meetings with designers, consultants, clients, stakeholder, etc. with everyone in the room and we all discuss and document important decisions on a project.  We had plans, renderings, and diagrams pinned up on the walls.  A project manager documented decisions, brainstorming, and ideas on large blank sheets of paper with a marker.  Others would write suggestions on sticky notes and place it on a wall in the conference room.  At the end of the day, a lot was discussed and resolved, and progress was made on the project.  How can we achieve this without being in the same place?  How can we adapt to a virtual process that gives us similar results? With certain whiteboarding platforms like Miro , facilitating these meetings can be (in some ways) better than it was in person.  We recently had a call with University of Chicago, one of our healthcare clients, and discussed taking one of their regular events called Kaizen and making it virtual. Kaizen is a Japanese term meaning “change for the better” or “continuous improvement.”  These meetings are usually in-person and involved 30-40 people, some of which travel from great distances to attend.  We were able to show them how Kaizen could be done virtually within a single Miro board.  All attendees would connect initially via Teams or Zoom meeting and link to the Miro board is posted in the chat.  Within one minute, all attendees are in the Miro board and navigating around the different areas which would basically be a digital representation of those large pieces of paper that you would have pinned up on the walls.  Each attendee can give input by placing sticky notes and typing text.  The project manager is still doing the job of keeping all attendees engaged in activities while another team member organizes content or documents good ideas being heard on the call.  The Miro board is versatile, and can show images, panoramic renderings, PDFs, Matterport scans, excel files, and many other file types.  There are also several templates for creating mind maps and simple diagrams on the fly.  For some mass interaction, we had some mentimeter polls accessible via QR code where people could respond with their smartphone.  At the end of the meeting, lots of decisions, ideas, etc. were documented and organized, and a digital version of the Miro board is captured and distributed to the attendees.  This condensed digital version is much better than the 40 photos you took of the conference room with the in-person meeting.  In the end, the client was very impressed at our innovative use of technology seamless integration with our expertise and ideas.",

Learning Objectives Learn the importance of incorporating building envelope characteristics and passive design strategies early in your design Identify passive design strategies to improve building energy performance Understand the concept of baseline and proposed design case for energy models Learn how to get your project on the path towards successful compliance modeling. Course Description The built environment uses nearly 36% of annual energy consumption and creates approximately 39% of all annual global greenhouse gas emissions, which leads to various climate-related hazards and health-related complications. The building sector has the highest potential for energy efficiency, consequently, it is essential to find ways to reduce load, increase efficiency, and utilize renewable energy resources in all types of buildings. This class will discuss the strategies for the design of your building relative to sustainability goals for whole-building energy simulation and design. The class will help you improve your project related to the massing and building envelope criteria to reduce the impact on operational energy use and carbon footprint. It also introduces a proprietary tool from Perkins&Will, called Simulation in Performance Energy Efficiency Design (SPEED), that provides accurate performance feedback and design information for various alternatives of your design. 1 AIA CES LU HSW Credits and LEED Self-Reporting Interactive Performance Design Strategies Matrix The matrix shows you the primary architectural dependent energy conservation measures with a direct relationship to a specific passive design strategy.

You will find v6.28 in software center to install.   It is suggested to always get on the latest version of each application you typically use to increase performance and stability and reduce errors and downtime.  To help support our design workflows a Conveyor update has been made available that in addition to small improvements will also function with Revit 2021.   The final update to the rhino ecosystem is an updated version of Vray for Rhino which you can also find in software center. It is suggested that you run these updates at the end of your workday to allow for the additional time it takes for installation to run in our work from home situation.   Always check back in on the installation progress to make sure you press yes or next to move installation progress forward and finally always always always restart before or after any installation process to reduce problems. In addition to Revit and Max 2021 being available, you will find the newest version of AutoCAD LT 2021 and Navisworks 2021 in software center for self-install and on all comp nodes that still remain in our network.   Should you need other Autodesk 2021 tools, we have regular AutoCAD 2021 and AutoCAD Architecture 2021 available for unique needs as well as Autodesk Vehicle Tracker 2021 for layout out turning radius and parking lots and docks for our designs.   We also have had Autodesk SketchBook Pro 2021 in software center for most of the summer for those looking for a digital hand drawing tool to support the virtual workflows our teams are using now.   You will need the proper hardware to effectively use this software and the digital pen that makes it work properly.  Finally, we have an update to the Autodesk dwg file viewer that will open any cad file you want to view.   This remains the default program for any dwg file that is double-clicked to open on your laptop. There is also a long list of other products Autodesk makes available to us each year that is very specialized and rarely utilized given the other tools and workflows our firm has in place.   However, if you should need anything else please submit a request at help@perkinswill.com in order to engage someone to help you get anything installed.",

    "content": "The newest version of Max available September 14 As we make Revit 2021 available to the firm this also brings the release of 3ds Max and other Autodesk 2021 titles.   This will be available on the comp nodes as well as found in software center for self-installation on your MSI laptop.   In order to make this function with our existing render farm, we will be updating the deadline platform to support Max 2021 on September 18th .  Also to help support our rendering workflows we are getting some licenses of the newest release of V-Ray for 3ds Max.  Also for those of you that use the iToo addins RailClone or ForestPack, those are being updated to also function with Max 2021. Installation The installations for Max, Vray, and RailClone will all be found in software center to self install at your convenience and need.   Be aware that there is a need for plenty of free space on your laptop to get these all downloaded to install as we work from home.   Also please allow ample time for the download process (and installation) to occur which will vary based on your location related to our cloud servers and your internet speeds.   Expect this to take multiple hours to go through the whole process, first to download then to click yes to proceed with the installation itself.   Also if you intend to install Revit 2021 on your laptop the amount of cache available with this installation system won’t support you install that and Max on the same day due to how Microsoft manages data resources. If you are having any issues with your installations from software center try restarting your laptop and trying again during off-hours.    If that doesn’t work submit a help request to help@perkinswill.com New Features Max’s main strengths are really adopting the physically based rendering (PBR) workflow with the new render independent physical material. Hopefully, this starts to solve the universal material workflow we’ve been seeking. Max now also includes the Substance plugin as part of the install, and these even further the universal material workflow. Max also has some updates to the chamfer modified which helps smooth edges on objects and this does it in a more effective manner. The chamfer is no longer “baked” into the geometry so you can modify it on the fly. The weighted normals modifier helps smooth out the appearance of curved surfaces without having to potentially rebuild the geometry. Vray 5’s main strengths are light mixer and layer compositing directly in the Vray Frame buffer. Essentially this workflow aims to remove as much of the noodling in Photoshop and be able to deliver HQ images directly from Vray.  You don’t have to rerender if you want change the look of your scene through lighting, you can now just adjust light values right in the interface without going to post-production tools. What is coming for your visualization needs iToo plugins update to be compatible with Max 2021 Vray 5 for Max licensing and installation availability All render farm machines will have Max 2021 and the associated addins listed installed Deadline will be updated on Friday, September 18th starting at 9:30 Eastern, 8:30 Central, 7:30 Mountain, 6:30 Pacific, 10:30 Sao Paulo, 2:30 AM (Saturday) London, 3:30 AM (Saturday) Denmark, 9:30 AM (Saturday) Shanghai.",

It has now come a time that we will update going from v12.2 to v12.4.   This may seem like a small jump but it will introduce a few new features and compatibility that will make Newforma work better for those that need to use it.   This update will be occurring this Friday evening (Saturday early morning in some locations). This maintenance window will begin at the following times where our desktop clients and servers will no longer work till updated and the info exchange website will be unavailable to everyone on any team external to our organization (or internal) till all updates are completed. 6:30 PM Pacific 7:30 PM Mountain 8:30 PM Central 9:30 PM Easter 10:30 PM Sao Paulo 2:30 AM London (Saturday) 3:30 AM Denmark (Saturday) 9:30 AM Shanghai (Saturday) We expect this update to take a couple of hours for the server updates with some of the larger offices taking a majority of the evening.   This maintenance outage time all depends on the number of projects in each local studio and their database size.   You current version of Newforma will no longer connect to the servers once this happens. Installation There is very little you will have to do in order to get the new desktop client.   Please restart your laptop at the end of the day on Friday and leave it plugged in and on when you walk away for the day.   At a minimum, you must close the Newforma desktop application and Outlook for it to properly automatically update.   The install will happen silently in the background beginning around those maintenance window times listed above.   You may run into issues if you haven’t restarted your laptop recently and have pending windows updates waiting.   If you have not used Newforma in the last 3 months then we will simply be removing the application from your laptop.  You will still have the ability to choose to install it from software center on your laptop at any point in the future should you need it again. If you are having any issues with the Newforma Outlook addin after the upgrade try restarting your laptop, after logging back in opening the Newforma desktop application, then opening Outlook.    If that doesn’t work submit a help request to help@perkinswill.com New Features User Interface One of the most noticeable items you will see after the upgrade is the slight change to the colors and icons in the interface.   With a couple of exceptions, it is all the same buttons in the same places but it will look new and fresh at first. One other noticeable change to the user interface will be the project home dashboard which gives you visibility of the status of various activities are items coming due for response.   If you don’t want to see quick status info on your project activities that you can filter there is a toggle button in to change it back to just the normal activity list we have always been used too. Connection to Procore is on the horizon.   We are working with IT to but some infrastructure in place in the background in order for us to enable connections between a Procore project and the Newforma project to automate moving RFI and submittal information back and forth between the two platforms.

    "content": "Innovative Virtual Presentation using Enscape and OBS This month, Mario and his ACAW team, Ted Hogan, Angelica Paleczny & Juliette Zidek, joined us on the VizR eXchange to share the unique way they presented their Terra Cotta panel design for the ACAW (Architectural Ceramic Assemblies Workshop) final presentation. As the annual in-person event turned virtual, our Perkins & Will team proposed a virtual 3D gallery model that all the participating firms can use to present their project in realtime using Enscape. On top of the 3D Gallery, our team used OBS studio (Open Broadcaster Software) and OBS Ninja to create a smooth streamlined virtual presenation that put our presenters front and center, while providing a common screen that showcased either the powerpoint or the 3D model live walkthrough, without ever having to switch presenters, or jump between screens and intefere with the presentation flow, thus providing a smooth and unified presentation that is both engaging and entertaining. The 3D gallery was designed as a nonagon (nine sided polygon) with a center space for common gathering. Nine firms participated in the workshop, and each firm has a wing of gallery space to showcase their design. Teams were able to be free of the typical limitation of budget and gravity, and be as creative as they want in creating their exhibition space. One thing our team wanted to avoid was any suggestion of the “uncanny valley”, where things looks quite wrong because it is impossible in our world. So to help the viewer maintain the connection to reality, our team made sure that our display respected the rule of gravity such as creating pedestal to hold up the small model objects, and back ties that ties the ceramic samples onto the wall.

    "content": "Revit 2021 available September 14th Each year our firm goes through extensive testing and preparations before we make the newest version of our primary documentation platform, Revit available for project teams.   We are at the time of the year that the Digital Practice team now releases the newest Revit for ALL new projects to start from.   Beginning Monday, September 14th you will find Revit 2021 installed on all of our remaining computational nodes and for those with MSI laptops, you will see it available in software center to self-install.  It is a large application to install and most of you will be installing it from home so I would suggest running it at the end of the day to allow for a few hours for the download time (which may vary based on your home internet speeds) and the installation.   In addition to Revit 2021 being available all other typically used Autodesk applications 2021 versions will be made available on the computational nodes and in software center as well.   3ds Studio Max, Navisworks, AutoCAD LT, AutoCAD and Vehicle Tracker, AutoCAD Architecture, and Sketchbook Pro can be self-installed and utilized.   In addition to new features in these programs year after year, the development teams at Autodesk work on fixing bugs and improving stability and speed for us which is another reason to always stay current. Each team should also make plans accounting for their project schedule and external partners to find a time to upgrade.   Fortunately, in BIM360 it is literally the click of a button.   More importantly, is that all models for your project will need to be upgraded at the same time to continue to allow everyone functionality of linking to all necessary information from each model.   All new projects should strategize to begin from the start in Revit 2021. Installation Another small change to how you get everything that comes with Revit is in the installer.   Previously Revit and every addin we have access to would be installed on every computational node that many people were using to get their Revit work done.  This will still be the case for the computational nodes remaining and the designers using them for Revit through the node selector.   However, for those of you installing Revit 2021 on your laptop, the basic install with Revit 2021.1 will include e-transmit, the basic CTC tools, the PW tools, and the Clarity client.   All other addins we have like Hive content library, CTC SuperDoor Configurator, Keynote Manager, JO Tools Transfer Project Standards, the pyRevit suite of tools, Metamorphosis model comparison, View AQC, and Autodesk Insight 360 analysis tool will all be separate installers from software center so you only install what you need.   This will prevent you from having to update an addin that you don’t use.   You can always come back and install any of these later when you have a need for them.   One other thing to be aware of with this work from home installations through software center is that not only do you have to account for a longer time frame to get applications installed but you have to have enough free space on your MSI laptop in order to do the installation.   You should have at least 40 GB of free space available on your laptop in order to install any of the Autodesk 2021 software packages.   You will also see the installation options for these Revit 2021 addins by using the software center filter at the top which will present all of them together for you so they are easy to find. New Features PDF & Raster Image Linking In previous Revit versions your only option was to Import these file types. The ability to link is a much welcomed feature. Where importing embeds files into the project, linking allows you to path to external files. This should help reduce your models file size, improve general model speed, and enhance graphic stability. The new Manage Links dialog In Manage Links, you will have two new tabs for PDFs and Images. Another cool feature here is we can path both of these file types to BIM360 just like DWG and Revit models. It is recommended that you host PDFs and Images on BIM360 for optimal collaboration and to make broken links a thing of the past. Shared Views Shared Views tool can be found on the Collaborate tab. Once toggled on, the Shared Views pane appears on screen. Comments and markups are visible inside Revit… Shared Views are for rapid sharing of views which can be marked up and commented on for team coordination. These views can be accessed from inside the Revit modeling environment or through Autodesk Viewer, a free web-based viewer. This web interface allows for orbiting, view filtering, walkthroughs, markups, and comments. Each individual shared view comes with a unique URL which can be shared with anyone. The web viewer is nearly identical to the BIM360 model viewer. However, this feature holds promise and already seems to be a more viable method for design based coordination since the views and commenting are integrated into Revit itself. There are a few limitations to Shared Views: You can only create a shared view from a 3D camera view or axon so no plan views or detail views can be shared. Can be shared with outside parties, but they will not be able to markup or comment without signing up for a free Autodesk account. The Shared View pane is not project specific. Meaning it will show you all of the views that you have created or have been shared with you regardless of the project model you are currently in. Shared views expire after 30 days. But you can extend them in the web viewer. Slanted Walls Perhaps the biggest architectural design addition is Slanted Walls. Walls have two new instance parameters, “Cross-Section” where you can change the default value from Vertical to Slanted. If Slanted is selected the new “Angle From Vertical” parameter will appear. A positive angle will slope the wall towards the interior and a negative angle will cant the wall out to the exterior. You can slant basic walls, stacked walls, and curtain walls. However, slanted Curtain walls have limited functionality. They cannot host door panels, they cannot be embedded into other slanted wall types, and adding mullion grids after slant is not user friendly. Elements hosted in a slanted wall, like Windows and Doors, will get a new “Orientation” parameter to specify whether you want them to follow the slant or to remain vertical. Left, slanted window. Right, vertical window (default.) In plan view, we see an accurate but distorted depiction. In summary, the slanted walls feature is long overdue but still lacks some usability. However, we may see some better functionality in future releases. Remember, it works best for basic walls and stacked walls but slanting curtain walls is clunky and doesn’t host door panels properly. For curtain walls and complex geometry, keep using mass with Wall by Face. Or Rhino with Conveyor. Generative Design Generative Design tools can be found on the Manage tab. The new generative design tool is basically Dynamo with a face lift. This is Autodesk’s first iteration of this feature so it is half-baked but may have potential. The current drawbacks are that the user interface is not very intuitive and the pre-loaded design studies are not relevant to our design work. Running generative design studies does not incur additional cost so feel free to test it out! In addition there are many other small improvements to Revit 2021: BIM360 opening and sync times 30% faster with 2021 models. Resetting Shared Coordinates tool allows you to break the relationship between files after coordinates have already been shared. All in-program dialog boxes are now re-sizable. Be sure to check out the Project Parameters dialog. Schedules have more functionality like zoom, freeze header, and row striping. Filters can now be enabled/disabled with a checkbox. This fix allows you better control filters without having to remove them from VG/view template. 90 new Dynamo nodes. Exporting models to native .STL filetype is now possible without installing add-ins.",

    "content": "ACAW 2020 This year Perkins&Will was invited to participate in the Architectural Ceramic Assemblies Workshop. The workshop’s main objective is to introduce and consider the properties of terra cotta earlier in the architect’s design process and to develop research and design models between manufacturing and architectural industries useful to the efficient production of high-performance facade solutions. It traditionally consisted of 3 separate phases: Design Phase : Between November and April all teams would work through their designs. This included having weekly calls with the ACAW coordinators and Boston Valley Terra Cotta. Fabrication Phase : Between April and Early August the teams work with the fabricators at Boston Valley Terra Cotta to optimize their designs and begin to fabricate. Workshop : In mid-August all teams would have flown to BVTC’s facilities to assemble their VMU’s and a showcase/presentation would have occurred. Unfortunately, due to the current pandemic we were not able to do this. We did, however, participate in a digital version and we had created a virtual exhibition space for our final designs. The Team The Participants Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture Handel Architects Kohn Pedersen Fox LMN Architects Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects PLP Architecture Skidmore, Owings & Merrill The Big Question What are the limits to controlling water flow on a vertical facade system? Intent and Precedent Sketching Through Possibilities As we experimented with different ways we could capture or control water we were also testing potential grid options for our panel. It was an interplay of geometry and surface articulation that was the primary driver of the panel design. Constant Iteration As we experimented with different ways we could capture or control water we were also testing potential grid options for our panel. It was an interplay of geometry and surface articulation that was the primary driver of the panel design. Water Flow Concept Conceptually the desire was to somehow control the flow of water across our panel design. Initially we had thought of also manipulating the glazing to some extent to achieve this control as well. With the design of a 3-point connecting system we knew we could create a consistent surface upon which water could flow. Surface Articulation Conceptually the desire was to somehow control the flow of water across our panel design. Initially we had thought of also manipulating the glazing to some extent to achieve this control as well. With the design of a 3-point connecting system we knew we could create a consistent surface upon which water could flow. Final Iteration The module’s evolution started with the desire to create a panel based on a 60 degree axis for consistent connection points. As the shape and definition of module became more defined, that connection and base geometries remained consistent. Orthographic Drawings Sections Structure We integrated 6 tapered support legs on the back of each panel. Each one of those tapered support legs then had offset holes removed from them such that we could thread through 1/4″ threaded rods and still allow full clearance of those rods. This meant that we could theoretically support or mount the panels in any configuration (horizontal, vertical, or hexagonal). 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 Tapered Support Leg 2 Silicone Footing 3 1/4” Threaded Rod 4 Bolt and Silicone Ring 5 Silicone Edge 6 Silicone Tongue Glazing Glazing and coloration was also very meticulously considered. Even from the beginning we thought of our design as a product. Something that could be mass customized and produced. Working with Boston Valley we pinpointed one glazing sample but produced a wide array of palettes . Form Glaze 1 Glaze 2 Resisted Previous Previous Previous Next Next Next By using the actual physical module, instead of the digital, any discrepancies caused during the terracotta’s shrinkage are able to be accounted for. The first glaze is applied at the inner portions of the module exposed by the resist. All other exposed areas of module are shielded, using the resist as guide. The second glaze is applied at the outer portions of the module exposed by the resist. The inner portions of the module with glaze 1 are now shielded to prevent any overlaps in glazes. The resist can now be removed and the module can be fired once more. Fabrication A majority of the fabrication is happening at a facility known as the Matter Factory out of Kansas City. We’ve gotten a few process photos that we’re incredibly excited about! Overall the the VMU is coming togther. Making the Mold Slipcasting the Panel Digital Workshop Presentation Ultimately we could not meet our peers physically but we did have the opportunity to assemble a digital space to showcase all of our hard work. Below you can see the small center space online. If you’d like to get a more expansive view of the workshop, feel free to download and run the enscape model using the button on the right.

    "content": "I did not have to sleep under my desk Dahmahlee Lawrence We discussed two very interesting topics at our August Design and Delivery Exchange : Utilizing Groups for detailing in Revit Deliver Differently  – CHoP  facade adaptive components from design to fabrication A detail group example for detailing masonry in plan Philip Chase shared Houston studio approach to detailing using the detail groups. The detail components and other graphic elements are grouped by the type of detail forming a “kit of parts” and can be inserted using Hive. Since they are developed in the same container file, the visual language is consistent, and because they are grouped, you get everything you need in a particular detail in one collection without searching for individual components and “borrowing” from other projects! You are probably familiar with Children Hospital of Philadelphia project: we talked about its computational parametric wall earlier here and here . In addition to many benefits realized during design process, we now can confidently say that precision of self-documenting parametric approach enabled worry-free reliable manufacturing of complex panels Complex geometry worked well all the way from design to documentation, fabrication and installation, Perkins&Will modeling helped in virtually removing geometry questions Rapid design iteration were fast and painless.

    "content": "Clarity is the firm’s tool to automate repetitive tasks on Revit projects. In addition to automating our output tasks like printing, Clarity can also run model comparison reports and/or visualization, run model metrics to help improve the quality and stability of your project models and automate other tasks using Macros or Dynamo scripts. As we move past the upgrade and you now have all the new features in your hand, one I would like to point out is the ability to identify problem model events so we can track and analyze the data to help us collectively focus our efforts to prevent downtime from Revit issues.   On the home page of your clarity project, you can find a pencil symbol in the upper right of the screen that gives you a drop-down menu where you can choose ‘report model event’.   When doing this you will be prompted to fill in a few fields so that we can look at the model data from that point in time and compare it with other people having model issues to find the patterns and elements that cause Revit to misbehave. Clarity will be unavailable during the upgrade process, which begins Friday, August 28th at 9:30pm Eastern, 8:30pm Central, 7:30pm Mountain, 6:30pm Pacific time and overnight (or into Saturday morning) at our international locations around the globe. Please plan accordingly with your project needs as you will have to run prints manually during this time frame if you are trying to meet a deadline.  We will begin pausing servers and tasks 30 minutes prior to the outage to let the system cleanout.   Any task in the queue that hasn’t started will continue to run after the upgrade (unless it is on Revit 2017). This version of Clarity features many new enhancements including: Functionality with Revit 2021 More functionality and integration with BIM360 hosted models Tracking problem models and their metrics to identify future problem models Navisworks file conversion tasks Workset specific tasks on BIM360 In addition to the new features listed here, there are more that you can view from the clarity help page here . We have been using Clarity for over 5 years now and it has saved the firm over 400,000 hours which equates to about 42 full-time employees for those 4 years.  Hopefully, this time was repurposed back to design tasks on all those projects by the team. Even with all that time saving we still don’t have all teams taking full advantage of this tool. Please work with your local Design Applications Manager or GTS support to set up your project in clarity is simple.   All you need to tell them in a help request is the path to your central files. After that is completed, it will only take about 10 minutes to get your typical project printing tasks set up and running. Please be aware that this upgrade means that the functionality of clarity will NO LONGER WORK WITH REVIT 2017 MODEL FILES (and older). If your project is in 2017 and going to continue on for a good amount of time please coordinate with your local design applications manager as well as your external project team members that work with your revit model file and consider an upgrade plan.",

    "content": "InDesign is one of the most widely used tools in our vast repertoire. Countless presentations, pursuits, marketing documents, and other important documents have been created using this platform with incredible results. Despite all this success, however, there has been a fundamental flaw with the InDesign workflow – exporting and reviewing markups… Anyone who has used InDesign knows this workflow… Finish presentation changes, check spelling, double check formatting Export to PDF and wait 5 – 20 minutes for the pdf to save Open the pdf and notice a mistake immediately Fix the mistake in InDesign Re-Export to PDF and wait Another 5 – 20 minutes Open the new pdf and compress the file size – save a new copy in the folder Write an email to the whole project team and attach the PDF for review Receive markups from several people each with slightly contradictory remarks Make the changes in InDesign and start the process all over again… After many late nights of rapidly assembling content for review, I used to consider my workday “done” when I finished making changes in InDesign. Realistically, though, it would always take another hour to save and send the PDF — it consumed loads of valuable time and there was no way around it. Until Now! The latest InDesign update provides a very powerful feature conveniently named “Share for Review”. It can be found in the upper right-hand corner under the “Share/Export” icon. Instead of exporting a large pdf file, this feature uploads a lightweight copy of your file to a web-hosted viewer. You can invite anyone you’d like via the InDesign panel (principals, team members, clients, friends, etc…). Once invited, users can view the document and add comments throughout. This live session allows everyone to see each other’s comments to avoid repetitive or contradicting notes. Web hosted document – Available to everyone with the link InDesign Review Feature – Available in the original file The great thing about this process is that it only takes seconds to share the file this way. Adobe used some form of magic to create a system that can publish a document to the cloud and share it to dozens of people in mere seconds, while exporting that same file to a simple pdf takes 20 minutes. The best part of all, though, is that the web document remains 100% live. Simply press “update” in the InDesign panel at any point to refresh the file online. You no longer have to stress about those little mistakes that forced you to re-export the time-consuming PDF every time. Changes are synced with a single button and appear within seconds. Any comments that were in the file remain intact so there is no need to worry about overwriting the valuable feedback added by others. So, what’s the downside you might ask? There are a couple quirks, the biggest is Adobe’s relentless subscription licensing requirements. To share or view documents this way, you must have an active CC suite license. While this is simple to acquire, it could certainly be a hang-up for high level staff that have limited time to navigate subscription logistics. Be sure to coordinate this ahead of time so the whole project team is up and running prior to a deadline. The other quirk is not necessarily bad — just something to be aware of. To remove completed markups you simply press the “Resolve” button in the browser. The good news is that the comment disappears, the bad news is it is gone forever. There is currently no option to hide or archive any comments. “Resolving them” completely deletes any record of it – a little problematic for intricate notes and critical feedback. Lastly, whomever shares the document will receive an email update for every single comment that is made in the document. This is a good notification for occasional notes. It is extremely annoying, however, when hundreds of comments are added in rapid succession. You can circumvent this issue by changing your notification settings to turn this feature off, just be aware that you will have to remember to check the document regularly for any new comments. Check out the demo video in the InDesign home screen and try it on your next project, I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised.",

    "content": "Since the beginning of the year, the Digital Practice community has been using a channel in Teams, Practice Lecture Hall , as a virtual gathering location to present concepts and ideas to build everyone’s professional skills.   As we have moved past the initial phases of working from home and realize that everyone is a little closer when few are in studios and everyone is connected virtually we see increased use of this channel by anyone to make their learning sessions more widely accessible to everyone around the firm.   We now see the NY technical studio training series joining the channel along sides the likes of the long-running PWU from our Boston studio and the Dallas Design Apps Continuing Ed series. You can find recordings from all of these presentations right in line in the chats and invites that you find on this channel.   You will also notice a tab at the top of the Practice lecture Hall channel called PWU Recordings with some curated courses from Boston and NY studios. If you would like to share your studio’s educational opportunities with a broader audience contact Nick Cameron or Matt Petermann to show you how to get setup.   This doesn’t require you to change your schedule or adjust your presentation content or topics.   It just gives more designers from other studios the opportunity to learn along side the people from your own studio. In addition to all of these studios, we have run many different series of continuing education from Digital Practice in this channel , including our monthly Visualization, Design and Delivery, Computation Design, and Performance Design calls.   We have held a series of Return to Studio classes on Microsoft Teams during the months of June and July in this channel.   We have also held two Digital Practice Core eXchange virtual conferences this year in this channel which have held 2,000 attendees for each quarterly offering. All of the Digital Practice recordings can be found in our eXchange library on our site or in Quickstart guides, such as the one for MS Teams on our site.",

    "content": "Digital Practice Core eXchange and Training Library Resources On July 14th through the 23rd Digital Practice team members and experts from around the firm completed another round of classes for our quarterly Digital Practice Core eXchange.  These continuing education sessions are designed to give our staff awareness and understanding of the tools and processes available to us at Perkins&Will. This quarter we had many new topics, as well as updating and improving many other topics from previous core exchanges.  Everyone was able to join the live sessions through Teams from wherever they are currently working and engage with the speakers to gain a better understanding in order to improve their work process. These live sessions were spread out over many days over the course of two weeks on our Teams channel for continuing education. If you weren’t able to make a session live or want to review one, you can find the recording in our ever-growing exchange library All sessions were registered for continuing education credits for you to meet your professional requirements through the AIA.  If you are part of another organization where you need continuing education units for your professional license you can typically self report these classes but check with your organization for specific details. The sessions are categorized by topics and you can view the recording and a slide deck and also connect with presenters for a follow-up discussion We had many highly attended classes and engaging question and answer sessions with those attending.   Some new ones that are relevant to working from home are a couple of new topics around BIM360 that looked further into the features of that platform, and also a session on virtual interview skills as we chase project work via virtual meetings.",

    "content": "Sketchup will be changing its licensing model over the next year. Because of this licensing change and several other factors we have decided not to upgrade Sketchup beyond the current version. This will essentially phase Sketchup out of the firm’s tool-set after June 2021 . The Digital Practice team will offer training to studios, project teams, and individuals on transitioning from Sketchup to Rhino as a conceptual modeling tool. Digital Innovation and leveraging computational tools on all projects are a core strategy of the firm. Additional training on advanced modeling, parametric modeling (Grasshopper), climatic and environmental analysis and refined workflows utilizing Conveyor and RhinoInside will also take place over the coming months. Thesenimble design tools allow your team more flexibility while creating efficiencies in documentation, while retaining design intent. You should have now upgraded to the latest release of Sketchup , as this is the last planned upgrade for Perkins&Will. Beginning on June 28th , a new dialogue box will appear when launching Sketchup informing you that the license is no longer under maintenance, this is to be expected and does not interfere with the operation of the application. If you have any questions, ideas or comments please feel free to reach out to me.",

Neil Reindel, from our Chicago office has been actively working with Hilmar and Johan from Arkio in testing the software and pushing what the software can do for us, and how it can help designers explore design options in the early stages using a Virtual collaboration tool.  After Hilmar and Johan demonstrated the basic features of Arkio, where collaboration can happen in virtual 3D between participants using different devices such as a browser on a PC or an iPad, and other participants wearing VR headsets. Neil showcased a project that he was able to bring the model from Revit, imported into the Arkio virtual platform, made design changes through iterations of design sessions and then send the changes back into Revit for further development. Thus completing the round trip workflow of moving data between Revit and Arkio. Arkio virtual collaboration Nick Cameron shared the latest development effort of expanding “Diversity in Rendering” and how we can do better by challenging our vendors and the rendering services to increase the diversity in what they offer instead of paying them for the clearly non-diverse libraries they currently offer. Mario Romero and Nick Cameron also showcased OBS studio and demonstrated how using the OBS studio could enhance our virtual presentation capabilities.

    "content": "mK-Process-Creating-a-Revit-Dashboard-in-PowerBi Download For many designers, there is a reluctance (and struggle) to manage their project data in Revit schedules. Let’s face it, they aren’t very pleasing to the eye and scrolling through hundreds or thousands of rows in a spreadsheet to get a few key numbers isn’t ideal. Furthermore, when these numbers need to get passed along to a project manager, principal, or client, you might try to format this information manually in Excel or InDesign which isn’t very efficient from a process perspective. This is where Automation and Data Visualization can help us tremendously, and you’ll see that the end result gives us meaningful information about our projects in a way that is interactive and visually stimulating. The video and PPT download link above can help you create a simple dashboard that tracks the square footage of rooms in your project. This process uses Dynamo to export data from the current Revit file to an Excel file.  In PowerBi, the Excel file gets linked and updates all the data visualizations (graphs, charts, tables, etc.) on the current report. DYN, XLSX, and PBIX files are provided .  As long as you have room elements placed in your Revit model, this will work on any project. Dynamo exports the following parameters from the Revit model: Room Name Room Department Room Area Room Level Example of the dashboard in PowerBI",

    "content": "Let’s Talk About Pedestrian Comfort and CFD Pedestrian comfort is a very important aspect of the built environment that has traditionally been outside of the immediate reach of designers and thus was relegated as something to be tested for ‘later’. CFD (computational fluid dynamics) software has been around for a while now but has been pretty inaccessible or somewhat difficult to integrate into the design process early enough to have a large impact. Fortunately we’ve developed a grasshopper workflow that will allow everyone to integrate CFD and pedestrian comfort into their early schematic designs fairly easily and rapidly. The Lawson Comfort Scale So, how do you translate wind speed to pedestrian comfort? There are numerous comfort criteria scales that exist but for this particular tool, we went with the Lawson Comfort Scale. It’s really easy to read and understand without over complicating the diagram too much. 1 2 3 4 5 1 Light breezes desired for outdoor restaurants and seating areas where one can read a paper or comfortably sit for long periods. 2 Gentle breezes suitable for main buildings entrances. Suitable for pick-up/drop off points and bus stops. 3 Moderate breezes that would be appropriate for walking down a city center street, park, or plaza. 4 Relatively high speeds that can be tolerated if your objective is to walk, run, or cycle without lingering for too long. 5 Winds of this magnitude are considered a nuisance for most activities and wind mitigation is recommended. A Few Things Before You Jump Into CFD CFD is an incredibly nuanced thing. There’s a reason that a whole other profession exists just focusing on it. There are a ton of variables that could affect the outcomes of your simulation. This tool aims to reduce the amount of guesswork that would go into running CFD analysis and tries to simplify the process. With that, here are a few things to note before you start: Make sure your model units are set to Meters Make sure Eddy3D is installed Double-check your simulation settings Eddy3D This tool is built on Eddy3D. A really fantastic CFD suite built for grasshopper and being developed by Cornell’s ESLab. To find out more about it click on the gif. Controls, In Five Parts Inputs Simulation Settings Probe Plane Settings Run Simulation Visualize Previous Previous Previous Next Next Next Simulation Name: This can really be anything, just make sure to not use any spaces. I always just replace spaces with ‘_’ anyway. Mass: This is where you’d input your project mass. Works better if it’s a closed polysurface but doesn’t have to be. Context: Your project context goes here. Same as above, works better if the geometry is either closed polysurfaces or extrusions. Protip : a quick way to get context is to go to www.cadmapper.com and grab some. Set EPW: Finally, set your project weather file (.epw) here. Here’s two great places to grab .epw files if you don’t already have one: https://climate.onebuilding.org/ https://www.ladybug.tools/epwmap/ https://www.energyplus.net/weather Scale: Sets the scale of the project. This really affects the accuracy of the building meshes. Detail: Sets the detail level of each mesh. This is a representation of the features of each mesh. Such as how accurate the corners will be. Sim Speed: This sets how many times the simulation will iterate. Obviously, the more iteration, the more accurate the simulation but also the longer it’ll take to run. Season: Right now we just have the ability to specify Summer and Winter but will add Spring and Fall/Autumn. This essentially allows the script to average the predominant wind vector for the season which you can visualize. Probe Plane Length & Width: Dimensions of your probe plane (which is just basically the grid of points you’re going to be using for your simulation). Test Height: The height of the probe plane. Should usually be at 1.5m-2m (5ft-6.5ft) if you’re testing pedestrian comfort. Grid Size: The size of the hexagons that you’ll use to test the simulation. The smaller the size, the higher fidelity the simulation but also the longer it’ll take to run. Usually 1m-2m is a decent size for tests. Show Grid: You can toggle between showing the grid or not. Useful for visualizing the grid before running the simulation. Generate Grid: Once you’re happy with the grid, toggle this to True to generate the grid for the simulation. 1.) Generate Mesh: Press this button to generate your meshes. Depending on your settings It should take about 5-15 minutes. 2.) Run Simulation: Runs the simulation based on all settings. Depending on settings, takes about 5-20 minutes. 3.) Visualize Probes: This generates the wind vectors on each point of the grid you generated (from the probe plane). You can visualize these separate from the pedestrian comfort diagram. 4.) Run Pedestrian Comfort: This calculates the pedestrian comfort on each hexagon (from the probe plane. Usually takes anywhere between 2-8 minutes. !!!Reset Simulation!!!: It’s red because it deletes your simulation data. You’ll need to press this before re-running your simulation if you’ve changed anything (usually if you’re testing a different massing. Each step in the simulation will look like this Show Pedestrian Comfort: Toggle to show the Pedestrian Comfort diagram. Show Wind Vectors: Toggle to show Wind Vectors. Show Wind Vectors Speed: Show the wind speed on each wind vector. Percent Comfortable: This is a nice little calc that spits out a percentage of the site that meets or exceeds the comfortability specified in the dropdown. Show Wind Rose: Toggle to show the wind rose generated from the .epw file. Show Average Wind Vector: Toggle to show the average prevalent wind vector. Visualizations The tool currently produces three types of diagrams: A Pedestrian Comfort Diagram A Wind Vector Diagram A Wind Rose Each diagram produces it’s own legend as well for easy legibility. All you need to do is print any view of the diagram you want to either an image or PDF to use it in your presentations! Pedestrian Comfort Diagram Wind Vector Diagram Wind Rose Previous Previous Previous Next Next Next 1 1 The pedestrian comfort diagram will automatically color the grid you generated based on the Lawson Comfort Scale. 1 1 The wind vector legend will be automatically segmented into 10 segments/colors. 1 1 The tool also generates a visual of the average prevailing winds. If you run into any problems or have any questions please feel free to hop into the Computational Design Channel and ask! You can download v6.0 of the script here: Download Now",

We will be holding a series of five more extensive classes looking closer at the ways Teams can help you Gather, Talk, Share, Accomplish, and Explore in a more complete way.   We have previously covered the basics and even intermediate sessions to help get everyone accustom to this platform when we all began working from home.  This will all be held on the Digital Practice Lecture Hall channel in Teams itself.   This is where we have been holding many continuing education sessions for the past couple of months, so look back for more new opportunities to grow your skills here. Get the most from your Teams Starting next week and for the following four weeks we will be breaking down the various aspects of what Teams can help you do.  In the first week will be talking about gathering and using meetings, calls, and the calendar in order to get together.   The second week will be all about talking and using channels posts and the individual and group chat features to communicate.  The third week will be all about sharing using the various things you can do with files through the Microsoft ecosystem.   The forth week will be about accomplishing your work and using tasks and the planner app to get things done.    The final week will be about exploring the rest of the ecosystem with the many tabs you can add to enhance your project’s workflow.   Things like the stream app, polly and forms to get feedback, using OneNote to compliment your project, adding PowerBI boards and its limitations and integrating other locations in the cloud into your interface. Each class will be offered that week during multiple sessions to make sure no matter what time zone you are in or what your current working schedule is that there will be an opportunity for you to join the conversation.   As always we will be recording these sessions for later viewing and posting them to our Teams Quickstart guide hosted on the Digital Practice site.   Please look for upcoming invites on the Practice Lecture Hall to get one of these sessions onto your calendar to make your project team a more cohesive unit virtually as if you were sitting in your pod in the studio together.

    "content": "Digital Practice holds a monthly Design and Delivery call which is a forum where we discuss productivity tools and share experiences, ideas and workflows. This monthly meeting shares exemplary workflows being leveraged across the firm to deliver our design intent. And we also give updates on Revit content and templates.  In the last couple of months experts from across the firm have presented and discussed various tools which can make you and your team more productive. On the latest Design and delivery call on May 14th , we talked about efficient use of Keynote Manager, its cloud component and new features that were developed in collaboration with Perkins&Will experts. If you have not attended that meeting and use Revit keynotes, the recording  of the training and user discussion are available here. Keynote Manager is a powerful  and intuitive tool which has multiple advantages comparing to Revit built-in keynoting, including interactive and easy keynote file editing, links and comments and Revit plugin  for applying keynotes in Revit, as well as tools for QA/QC. User feedback is amazing: everyone who have used KM on the project said they would never go back! However with WFH, we strongly recommend using KM cloud for hosting Keynote files, to avoid possible file locking. Next week, on Thursday, June 11,  experts from around the firm will share different tools and approaches that help our designers respond to Covid-19 crisis Please use this LINK to register for monthly calls.",

As a result of this absence from office life, we have held off on many pending software updates, only making critical updates available and not required as we have typically done in the past.   When you find yourself returning to the office please account for some time at the start of your day to let your laptop catch up to all the optional updates that we have prepared and will improve the features, stability, and speed of your design applications.   You can find many of these in software center and in some cases, you will be prompted to update something on your laptop.   When running these please make sure you restart your laptop first do reduce unexpected reboots due to pending windows updates.   Also don’t move your laptop off your dock or close the lid until the updates have shown dialog boxes declaring the install is complete. In the coming weeks there are some updates we will be pushing out to the firm that will be required while you are away.   This will be an upgrade from Bluebeam 2018 to 2019 and an upgrade from SketchUp 2019 to 2020.  Both of these are required for all designers with the software and are a result of our licensing agreements.   Please keep an eye out for these to find a time to run them when you are away from your laptop as they will take a little longer than typical depending on your homes connection speed. As always we are trying to minimize disruption to your design work while keeping your applications up to date to maintain security, functionality, and add value to your design process.   You can always help us by remembering to regularly reboot your laptop often to reduce problems and avoid unexpected behavior when you need your machine the most.  Please let us know if you have any feedback to keep finding ways to improve this process for you.   Thanks.",

While on a Teams call, the different team members were able to discuss each\ntask and assign them a Week of the project that it needed to be completed by.  After weekly assignments were done, with extra\ntime to spare, the project team could flip to the Calendar view on Planner and\ndrag each task on specific days.

    "content": "For the Sake of the View View analysis and view obstruction analysis are fairly critical in the early design process. They can provide a lot of feedback in regards to your massing and can easily help to inform massing changes. Unfortunately they’re a bit tedious to do over and over again after each massing iteration and, on taller projects, for each floor. Let Computation Help Fortunately we’ve developed a pretty simple script to help you visualize these types of diagrams incredibly quickly. The script just needs context and your massing to run the analysis in real-time. You can specify the floor to floor height, what level you’d like to generate the analysis from and the distance the view cones should analyse. This will then generate the view diagrams with a text overlay indicating how far you can see before an obstruction is in view. Tightening the Feedback Loop It’s very simple to use and easily integrated into your workflow. It can be used in real-time to inform your design decisions and hopefully tighten that data to design feedback loop just a little more.

This quarter we had five new topics in the mix, as well as updating and improving a dozen topics from previous core exchanges.  Everyone was able to join the live sessions from their homes and engage with the speakers to gain a better understanding. This time live sessions were spread out over many more days than previously. We also moved them all to the Microsoft Teams platform which gave us a much better experience of giving and consuming these topics.  If you weren’t able to make a session live or want to review one, you can find the recording in our ever-growing exchange library In addition to offering theses sessions on a more dynamic platform we have also registered them for continuing education credits for you to meet your professional requirements. The sessions are categorized by topics and you can view the recording and a slide deck and also connect with presenters for a follow-up discussion In addition to quarterly eXchange events, we are working with many studios to make available PW U events that local studios are hosting for their designers to make available to all employees firmwide in our Digital Practice Lecture Hall . Look for upcoming schedules for additional ongoing training opportunities on various topics around design, building typologies, construction contract administration, office culture, and more. If you already have something going on in your local studio that you would like to share with the larger audience please reach out to Matt Petermann to help coordinate those efforts.",

    "content": "When the pandemic caused our company to switch to WFH (work from home), we were prepared. We had a plan, ready-to-deploy technology, know-how and confidence to get it done very quickly and efficiently. Perkins&Will has maintained a lot of online resources before the current health crisis. During this WFH time, we developed additional resources, communication channels and support methods. This guide will help you to find a resource you need. Platform.PerkinsWill.com is a good place to start. There you will find up-to-date company information, best practices for communications, tips about working from home efficiently,  information about upcoming training and past training recordings (more of that at Digitalpractice.PerkinsWill.com/ ). This site is updated frequently with relevant information from management, Information Technology and Digital Practice. Please note quick links on top. Pressing Help here is just one more way to send a Help Request to the GTS Helpdesk. For more in-depth coverage or design applications and other self-help resources, go to to https://digitalpractice.perkinswill.com/ . Digital Practice has maintained this site long before WFH began and it is a treasure trove of information. Use the tabs on top to check out newsletter articles, future training schedules and past recorded training sessions delivered by digital practice in collaboration with subject matter experts around the firm. From the resources  tab, you’ll find our Quickstarts – concise landing pages for all of our major applications. The MicroKnowledge site is already a favorite of many PW designers. It contains more than 600 how-to slides answering many common questions.  This content is searchable and well organized by application/process. In Training Library you will find recordings of past training sessions and a schedule of upcoming events. In addition to online resources, we use Teams to stay in touch and provide interactive live support to answer your questions. In the General Channel you can ask questions and someone will get back to you with the answer. This channel is monitored by Digital Practice and many experts from around the firm. The Digital Practice Lecture Hall is a channel where all the scheduled training sessions are happening. When there is an active session in progress, you will see a camera icon text to it. During the last two weeks we were conducting our quarterly eXchange sessions there, and feedback showed that they were enthusiastically accepted and appreciated by PW staff. Digital Practice Virtual Office Hours is a hangout for anyone and everyone who has questions, concerns, or just wants to discuss something with a member of DP teams in-person. This “walk-in channel” is manned by our DP team.  The first session starts at 9AM EST, and then sessions happen every two hours. When it is “in -session”, you will see the camera icon next to the Channel name. We have already migrated most of out projects to BIM360.  However if your project needs to be migrated, please fill out the information in t his spreadsheet , and someone will help you.",

    "content": "On the most recent VizR call our guest speaker demonstrated a highly collaborative VR experience appearing to embrace the advantages of virtual workspaces. The Wild as it is called is promoted as a real-time, immersive collaboration even though an immersive headset is not a requirement. In addition to joining The Wild using a monitor or headset an iPad is also an option. According to Gabe Paez, CEO the environment can easily host more than nine simultaneous users. Unfortunately people have expressed feeling too crowded as numbers exceed nine. Still nine is not a small number of collaborators. Scaling plays a useful role within The Wild. The environments witnessed ranged from Revit and SketchUp designs to workspaces to inserting those designs into workspaces appearing to be scale models on a table. Each person also has the ability to change their scale within the environment which happen often in the demonstration. Changing scale appeared to have advantages for reviewing, editing and exploring the designs. Note the two people at smaller scale on the grass of the model The Wild is cloud-based and integrated with Revit, BIM360 and SketchUp. There is a Revit add-in which pushes your Revit project into The Wild where collaboration can occur across the office or the world. The Wild features menus to create, modify and insert. The menus are visible to each person operating the menu and others within the environment. The types of things  inserted into the projects or workspaces seemed unlimited. It is easy to imagine how people or teams could create virtual workspaces for each project filled with project related content.  These virtual workspaces would be like like physical workrooms or conference rooms where nothing has to be removed before the next meeting. Unconstrained by size or scale inhabitants could spatially order project information in a way we all  innately understand. The presentation ended with the offer for Perkins&Will designers to experience using The Wild. This offer has not been made to Perkins&Will in past demonstrations. We look forward to exploring The Wild in April. If you would like to participate please reach out to me and I will ask if there is availability.",

    "content": "The Washington DC studio and Digital Practice has recently been piloting a new scanning process to create “Digital Twins” for our design teams and clients. The Matterport Scanner and its accompanying web portal has been used to scan over 30 projects so far! If you have shopped for an apartment or house in the past few years you have probably already experienced a Matterport scan. Here are some takeaways on what we have been learning. Yes, laser scanning has been around for a while . However, the old methods of scanning, required ample investment in hardware, proprietary software and complex workflows to open the scan in design applications (ie Revit). Matterport was developed for the real-estate market, continuously finding ways to streamline the equipment and process, making it easier, faster and cheaper for our design teams to leverage scanning of commercial spaces. This type of scanning [for now] is best suited for interior projects, especially of existing spaces. Besides the benefit of having a measurable “Digital Twin” for our design teams to leverage, we also believe we can share a scan of the finished project with our clients. Updating the “Digital Twin” periodically after project completion can be a mechanism for touch points with our clients between projects. Silas Haslam, from the Washington DC studio has been championing the effort of scanning during the construction phase. Each scan published by Silas to Matterport’s online portal has allowed the design team to easily navigate the model with their phone and an internet connection. Needless to say, the value was obvious, and it’s use cases seemed endless. See previous post for examples… Like Enscape, I tend to attribute the success of Matterport to its user friendly infrastructure. Simply stated, we don’t have the time to learn a new software or workflow. The MatterPort process has proven so simple and intuitive, training is almost not necessary, a 10 minute overview is normally enough to get someone scanning. If you have an upcoming project or a recently completed one, and would like to create a Digital Twin, please reach out and we can FedEx a scanner to you. If you would like to learn more about the projects already completed and additional use cases, check out this earlier blog post and this eXchange Presentation on Reality Capture . Save time on money and travel… Remove user error when it comes to accuracy…",

    "content": "Technology is full of potential, with its opportunities\nranging from exciting experiences to convenient solutions. Its role in cities,\nhowever, is often a topical issue to be discussed. Through our Innovation\nIncubator Augmented\nUrbanism: How to Build a Positive AR Future , Patrick Bayer and I take a\npositive and solution-based approach in exploring what XR (extended reality)\nwill mean for urbanism. Inspiration to dive into this topic stemmed from the\nconcept film, Hyperreality , by\nKeiichi Matsuda, which highlights XR’s potential for a frightening future. As\nthis technology will fundamentally affect the places we design, as architects,\ndesigners and planners, we should see it as our responsibility to help guide\nthe extended reality industry toward a positive future for our cities. This past January, we hosted a design charette with our San\nFrancisco office as a kickstarter to our research. We asked what impact XR can\nhave on interiors, buildings, and the urban environment. The energy around the\nconversations was exciting, as people discussed the many possibilities. Some\ntakeaways centered around the educational role that XR can play in teaching\nothers on topics such as climate change and the history of place. There were\nalso conversations about the flexibility in not only design but also the design\nprocess. The charette ended with a discussion around the ethical implementation\nof XR and how it will be important for us as designers to have a frank\nunderstanding of what our values are. Our next steps are to take these conversations and analyze\nwhat it means through a research paper. We will also be creating a series of\nvignettes to connect the experience of XR with our goals for the future. Stay\ntuned!",

    "content": "The Importance of Sketching: There has always been a fine line between process and representation in the architecture studio. One is often feeding the other. The importance of a fluidity between the mind, heart, hand, and paper cannot be overstated. The Promise of The Paper Free Architecture Studio The notion of a paperless studio has been around for decades. In 1994 – under the direction of Bernard Tschumi – the Columbia\nGraduate School of Architecture, Planning and Presentation undertook a series\nof experiments with the paperless studios. Tschumi proposed that how an\narchitect expresses themselves, is closely related to how they think. If CAD was the way of the future, then architectural thinking must adapt itself to this new method of representation. Coming at a time when the profession of architecture was rapidly computerizing, this was a powerful thought. But the experimental studios were eventually abandoned. The relationship between the mode of notation and the way of thinking is fundamental to the profession of architecture. Sketching is a mode of notation that’s much better able to take on a layer of abstraction that’s necessary. While analog tools like pen and paper have been doing a fine job of fulfilling this role, there are still numerous benefits to a digital sketching process in the design studio. A Pilot In the Vancouver Studio The MQCC team in the Vancouver studio has been piloting the use of the Tablet in their design process.  They currently share the use of 5 iPads that float between 12 people, in two offices. Here are some ways the team is making use of the tool: Quick sketches Brainstorming Optioneering Concept Design Design Process Diagrams Detail Design Markups Meeting Collaboration and Communication Apps and Workflows Morpholio Trace An example workflow using Morpholio Trace Past attempts to digitize the experience of paper have had\nlimited success in the architecture studio. Wacom tablets, touch capable laptop\nscreens, Smart Boards, Smart Surfaces, all failed because of one simple fact: real\npaper is un-complicated. Of all apps we tested, Trace gave real paper a real run for\nits money. It’s designed specifically for Architects. It’s simple to sketch, layer,\niterate. The app has rulers, scales, perspective guides, entourage stencils and\ndifferent brush presents that make it easy to go from shading to outlining. Today Trace is more popular than real trace paper with the MQCC team because it bridges the gap between digital and physical. How do you sketch over a computer model? You no longer have to print an underlay. Just hold the iPad up to the screen for a quick shot. Working in a layered system, and having undo and redo are also clear advantages to real paper. Procreate Some members of the MQCC team prefer to use an app called\nProcreate. While quite similar to Trace, it’s designed for artists and\nillustrators, so it can provide a bit more power and control for more polished representation. Procreate supports serious customization of the interface with shortcuts and touch gestures. Users that are more advanced and committed to the digital sketching process were able to reap these benefits. For others, having to learn an interface was a barrier to entry. Duet Display We had initially begun the pilot with a Wacom Tablet, but\nquickly found it clumsy and impractical. Users had to plug in three different\ncables every time they returned to their desk. Touch gestures were limited. The\nsoftware driver software was unreliable. It would often fail to recognize the Wacom\ntablet as an extra display and force the user to restart their computer. When testing and iPad with Duet display as an alternative we\nrealized it was vastly superior experience. Designers were now completely\nwireless. No more being tied to the desk you were plugged into to. If you want\nto have a discussion with a colleague, you can just walk to their desk with the\ntablet – like a stack of trace paper. Multi touch gestures and the stability of\nthe software made the iPad feel as seamless as paper. Two successful workflows with Duet Display: As a pen tablet: for finer control Morpholio Trace\nand Procreate are great, but sometimes getting that final level of control in\nphotoshop is just what you need. Duet enables an iPad and Pencil to act as another\nmonitor with pressure sensitivity and multitouch gestures. Like a Wacom tablet,\nonly wireless. This method is great for sketching, and marking up documents. Our team has successfully tested this in Photoshop, Affinity and Bluebeam. As a collaborative whiteboard The MQCC team spread over two offices. Previously, teams would draw on a whiteboard, alienating colleagues on the other end of a conference call. Duet display is being used to improve collaboration in meetings. Both teams cast their screen to a projector or TV in their respective meeting room. An iPad on each side is passed around the table for people to contribute to one shared drawing. Questions? Contact Elton Gjata in the Vancouver Studio.",

    "content": "Ricoh Theta Z1 Review and Theta S Comparison The information below focuses on the use of 360 photos for our practice.  To date the most common use of the Theta S camera in the Chicago office is for taking as built photos of education facilities.  Other Perkins&Will offices are taking 360 photos for markting purposes to showcase project work.  The Digital Practice group has been documenting the Perkins&Will offices with 360 photos and videos. One of the issues with the Theta cameras is with battery drain when at project sites taking photos of many spaces over a period of time.  Out of Chicago the Theta S is supplied with an Anker battery pack for charging.  The battery pack can charge the camera when moving between spaces to be photographed.  This is process is not ideal though because charging is slow and the teams may have to wait until the camera is charged enough to continue.  So specific tests outlined below focus on management of battery levels.  The project teams in Chicago also expressed that higher resolution and higher quality images would be helpful to capture as much detail as possible. The Theta cameras stich images to JPEG immediately after photos are taken which makes the camera very easy to work with.  The Insta360 camera, for example, saves images from the camera to an insp and dng raw format where JPEG images must be exported from an application.  The Theta can simply be connected to a laptop and JPEG files accessed directly.  The Theta Z1 now supports RAW DNG files that can be edited, enhanced and exported.  More information on DNG below. Additional Theta Z1 camera features include:  connect to camera via bluetooth, still image self timer, interval shooting, video shooting, live streaming, many typical camera settings are available such as exposure, HDR, white balance, etc. The Ricoh Theta Z1 and Theta V are compatible with Matterport.  Contact the Digital Practice group and the Matterport website for more information.

Or, you could just remodel your stuff in revit. If you\nlike not having any personal time at all. However, there’s a better way to do\nthis. In comes Conveyor . The old way of doing things So What is Conveyor? It’s this pretty handy rhino and revit plugin that allows you to very easily transfer rhino geometry to revit. All you need to do is simply setup your rhino file from Conveyor and you’re good to go. The great thing about Conveyor is that all geometry is imported as native revit data. So The easy Conveyor way When should I use Conveyor? Now there’s a few questions you’ll need to ask yourself before you begin using Conveyor. Luckily we’ve prepared a handy flow chart: How do I get started with Conveyor? Conveyor should already be installed on your machine (if not, ask your local DA! Once that’s up and running take a look at the recent Core eXchange presentation that Taylor Boyer and I hosted last month: Core eXchange – Conveyor Things to Keep in Mind: While Conveyor is really simple to use once you’ve familiarized yourself with it a little, the workflow requires a bit of a mental shift. Geometry in Rhino will have to be assigned to predetermined layers that represent the type of revit elements that the rhino geometry will be converted to (please see the below Conveyor Layer Key) Conveyor allows you to Origin Match to your revit file but you must prepare your rhino export file from within revit to get your projects origin, levels, and grid lines Keep note of what elements can and cannot be updated and replaced when going from rhino to revit (as listed in the Conveyor Layer Key) Lastly, Conveyor is a Rhino to Revit tool only. It does not do Revit to Rhino. Conveyor Layer Key",

    "content": "Designers at Perkins&Will responded to a Digital Practice survey around Black Friday asking which tasks in Revit they found the most repetitive, time consuming or were among their least favorite. During December these survey results were analyzed and organized into like comments. Respondents were asked to type their answers followed by lists of known repetitive, time consuming and least favorite Revit tasks. The five most selected items from the lists were Sheet Naming / Renaming, Annotating and Dimensioning, Family Editing, Doing a Door Schedule, and Prepping CAD drawing for Revit import. Top 5 Responses Selected from a List Results for freely typed in answers were more challenging to calculate. Answers were grouped into like categories with some answers spanning multiple categories. In early December our first efforts to organize the type-in answers resulted in six key take-aways as follows below. Key Take-Aways from Early December Setting up / creating / populating Naming / renaming and/or numbering / renumbering Door schedules – creating / revising Drawing indexes – creating / revising Aligning views / plans on sheets Tags – inserting and/or adjusting for legibility Review and organization of type-in responses resumed later in December. This was an effort to better address the frequent overlap of type-in responses across multiple categories. Near December’s end there was a similar, but new list. This late December list more accurately captures respondent’s type-in answers. Top 3 Type-in Responses from Additional Analysis in Late December Populating Projects and Project Templates Creating and Revising Door, Drawing and Other Schedules Annotation – Tagging, Dimensioning, Keynoting including adjusting for legibility Efforts to respond to the items identified in the survey has already begun. Digital Practice is exploring possible solutions and communicating with designers whenever a better understand of the issue is needed. If you have a potential solution, suggestion or comment to contribute to one or more of these issue please email Iffat Mai, Nick Cameron or Dan Chasteen. Thank you to those that took time to respond to our survey. We are working towards potential solutions to the issues you identified.",

    "content": "The Charlotte Studio\nis moving! The Charlotte Studio of the North Carolina Practice is currently preparing for a location move and everything else that comes with it. As a Design Firm, the design of Perkins&Will offices is an important factor in portraying our values and beliefs. The design studio is a place for inspiration, collaboration, showcase for our clients, and most importantly…where we spend most of our day! With all this in mind, This is a difficult (but fun) challenge to the design team on how to incorporate everything that is wanted and needed and wrapped up in a beautiful design. The team is exploring the design of the space in all of the traditional ways is by sketching, modeling, material studies, and rendering. Since this is an article on the Digital Practice website, we would be remiss not to mention the use of the technological side and nontraditional design methods the team is using with the use of Virtual Reality and VR goggles. Axon Floor plans of the New Charlotte Studio Space Recently, the entire\nCharlotte Studio walked over to the new space for an offsite Beer Time and a\nchance to see where the new office would be. The Team presented everything that\nthey have been working on; Floorplans were pinned up, material boards were layed\nout, and the VR goggles were used. At this time, the design was still in\nSchematic Design so the concept and space layout were still being tweaked and\nrefined. The team presented their ideas to the rest of the office and also\nreceived some helpful ideas and suggestions. Trying on the Oculus Rift-S Headset Eric Taylor entering Virtual Reality Material and Rendering Pin Up Discussions about Needs and Wants The team has been\nusing working mostly in Revit and using Enscape as the main render and VR tool.\nWith the new MSI computers the workflow of design, model building, rendering,\nand VR has been seamless and efficient. The team has been able to work through\na lot of iterations and ideas by using all these tools together and pushing the\ndesign forward. While on site the VR goggles and model were placed in a central\nlocation and started in the same place Virtually. It was insightful for\neveryone to look at the floorplans and also be able to ‘stand’ in the place\n(Physically and Virtually) to truly understand the layout and new design of the\nspace. Even as Architects and Designers who are able to think spatially, the\nuse of VR was helpful to walk around in the model, take them off and see the\nactual space. As an exercise this was helpful to the studio to share feedback\nto the team,  get excited about the new\nspace, and think about how we can use all of our tools with clients. Stay tuned for more\ndesign updates and pictures of the Charlotte Studio! Update: 1/24/20 Entry Entry & Lab Kitchen Lab & Small Conference Large Conference Open Lab Studio",

    "content": "Adding value and squashing bugs Many items have already been updated the first month of this year, below is just a quick recap as to what some of those are that you should be aware of. Revit 2020 Update 2 This major release adds some new functionality.   There were improvements around the new path of travel feature as well as an attempt to resolve corrupt models with missing elements.  They also keep improving the desktop experience to be in line with BIM360 cloud improvements.   As with all versions of Revit you entire team should be on the exact same version to reduce issues with your model file. Max 2020 update 3 This update as with the previous continues to address a list of bugs in the software. Upgrade to Clarity 2020.1 This major release adds some new functionality including new tasks for BIM360 projects and a new task to export schedules.   Many other small bug fixes and items were added as well. Updates to all Insight 360 Revit addins including 2018, 2019, 2020.   This update can be found in software center for those users that utilize this cloud function as it relates to Revit.  These keep the addin consistent with the updates they are making to the product in the cloud. Keynote Manager 16 This update includes small improvements and compatibility with new licensing schema by the developer. PW Tools We have update our own Revit addin to make sure all functions are compatible with BIM360 models as well as improving the new project creation for the BIM360 process.  This update was made available for Revit 2019 and 2020. Enscape updates These updates are done for unseen items to how the application is compatible with some of the newest nVidia graphics cards which drives the visualization.   These cards are found in all of our newest generation of MSI laptops across the firm that are part of our Platform 3.0 Deadline 10 update This update was for background compatibility reason to make sure deadline functioned properly with other applications that are running on your laptop. There are more items coming soon with planned updates to Rhino 6, Convey, V-ray Next, Autodesk desktop connector, Navisworks, dRofus, and a handful of other application plugins.   The Digital Practice team carefully considers which updates our firm needs and is not always pushing every update to every machine in the firm.   This is to minimize the interference with your regular needs to use your laptop to design.  We will always need your help making sure you are finding the time to run these addins when prompted or on your own schedule through the software center on your laptop.",

    "content": "Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and all other Adobe Creative Cloud applications will be upgraded to the latest version over the next month. This email marks the beginning of a two week phase that provides the option of upgrading at your convenience from Software Center . Beginning on February 6th you will begin to be prompted to install the update which you can defer each day for up to 2 weeks. All Computers will be upgraded automatically on February 20 th if not already complete. How to plan for this update The process will remove all Adobe 2018 apps installed on your computer except Adobe Acrobat and install all the same 2020 Adobe apps. You will be able to continue using any non-Adobe programs during the upgrade process.  The upgrade takes anywhere from 20 minutes (in the office with only the typical PS, AI, and ID) to 2 hours (outside of the office or on wifi with additional applications). Consider your project or team Please consider and communicate with your team members before upgrading.  Each application deals with differences in versions in their own way.  Your team might be a project team or a proposal collaboration between design staff and Marketing.  Don’t put a deadline at risk due to poor planning.  An Adobe product version compatibility document is listed below. File type / Application Information Action PDF/Acrobat No changes No action required PSD/Photoshop Backwards compatibility seems to depend on whether you have used some of the latest functionality in 2020.  If you need compatibility with others who may not have yet upgraded please always choose “Maximum Compatibility” Always choose “Maximum Compatibility” option when prompted at save until the final upgrade deadline (February 20) AI/Illustrator Many elements, especially type, have been updated in the file format for Illustrator 2020.  The Illustrator file format for 2018 and 2019 is now called “Illustrator CC (Legacy)” INDD/InDesign Files are converted to latest version if saved in 2020.  Older versions of InDesign can convert 2020 files to be compatible but then a copy must be saved.  There is no collaboration between InDesign versions. Coordinate your upgrade with those you work with to maintain the ability to edit the same InDesign files. Premiere Pro The file format for 2020 is all new and not compatible.  Upon opening a file from an older version you are required to save a new file that is compatible with 2020. One issue that we found while testing is that video taken from phones (especially iPhones) shows as upside-down after the Premiere file was upgraded.  You can resolve the issue on affected clips by making them “offline” and then re-linking to the original file. Save the new copy of the file with a name that indicates 2020 and use the new version going forward. If you collaborate on video editing with others, coordinate your upgrade with them.",

    "content": "As we look forward to a new decade, we thought it would be interesting to look in retrospect at technology in design over the last ten years and also think about what’s in store for us. In the 2010’s, we have seen the [re]introduction of VR but probably more importantly the ushering in of “real time “ rendering engines like Enscape and Lumion. The hope of interoperability between modeling tools Rhino and Revit have come a long way and we think it is almost [who has heard that one before] there. A lot of discussions over the past ten years have circled around Building Information Modeling “BIM” and still do, but the understanding of design modeling and its limitations has matured, will the next decade bring the necessary software solutions to finally deliver the model? Computational design was relatively niche back in 2010, but has become mainstream in universities, and now every studio has a handful of designers scripting, what will they craft in the 20’s. The firm has grown, the hardware we utilize has improved and the next decade will bring even greater improvements. So will we have a return to the “roaring 20’s”; let’s see what may be to come: I foresee the design industry being disrupted by changes in how we manage, analyze and visualize big data sets. The move towards visual programming is making software development more accessible to design teams. I believe machine learning, and eventually full AI, will allow us to analyze large data sets to make educated design decisions. I believe these changes and advances in digital fabrication will lead to redefining the entire design and construction process from an end-to-end life-cycle and supply chain view. Razan Altiraifi Washington DC Studio In the next decade, I foresee a direct application of machine learning widely disrupting the design process as we know it. Machine learning is dependent on large, clean data sets and Perkins&Will has such an extensive data set (past projects) that have been successful and well documented. We will be able to leverage these data sets in a way that ML could be leveraged to automate a lot of the initial documentation; such that, as we design mock sets for those design will run in tandem. Mario Romero Digital Practice With the portability of VR that was introduced this year, I do not think it will take long for more of our DD meetings in VR than on paper, specifically in healthcare. VR allows us to communicate with end users more effectively than ever; streamlining the DD process and limiting the mock-ups needed. Integrations with BIM 360 make it easier than ever for platforms to piggyback off our models, making our models and their accuracy more important than ever. Though the contracts are slow to change, the construction industry will continue to push architecture and engineering to create models that are “ready to build”. It will be interesting to see how the industry standard contracts change to meet the ever-growing integration of technology in our industry. Rachel Gruber Dallas Studio The 2000s began with existing disbelief about the application of digital tools in the practice of architectural design. However, the 10s ended with excessive flourishing adoptions of The Digital while some were still considering. As a consequence, in the realm of design, rising global optimism to the performance added by utilizing the digital can mainstream digital collaboration, human-machine interaction, and above all, computational iteration and optimization in almost every design process. Ali Amirakbari SHL Our teams will be more diverse with users scientists psychologists sociologists, material specialists, construction managers, and architects, interior designers, urban designers, and digital masters. Robert Brown Boston Studio I foresee the design industry being disrupted by newer, experimental, and agile methods of direct-design-to-fabrication.  These make their best use of refinement of design intent down to the essentials of pure constituent elements that align with the use of location intelligence, automated fabrication, and a system of algorithms.  The algorithms in both bits and synthetics, but driven by human ingenuity and innovation, make the best match of construction systems, performance, material intelligence, embedded electronics, and environmental barrier suitable to a particular climate or harsh environment like off-world. In the end, we do not need the model, but rather the underlying design intelligence of the project. Tyrone Marshall Atlanta Studio I foresee the design industry being disrupted by companies like google, sidewalk labs and airbnb advancing into the AEC marketplace with new tech offerings that designers can tap into. The business model in our industry will continue to transform as more of a specialist services model and it is possible that companies that maintain the traditional approach of bums on seats may not survive. It will also be interesting to see if the huge investment in proptech and contech in the last two years will further continue and if these companies succeed or fail over the next few years. Robotics will continue to develop and play a big part as the technology that drives them becomes more cost effective, faster and common place. David Sewell London Studio In the next decade, I foresee the design industry being disrupted by ………climate change and how technology will help reverse the negative impact buildings have had with this issue. Jason Diamond Atlanta Studio The future is all about machines, very dramatic to say it in such terms. I believe that in the next decade Automation and Machine Learning will gradually take central stage, bringing with them a strong, very much needed, data driven foundation, and changing the way we approach the design process as we know it. The biggest challenges for each one of us will be first of all to be willing to embrace the change, to be ready to dynamically adapt to the fast pace of technology, and most importantly to be able to firmly take the steering wheel of these “new” emerging technology. Giancarlo Gastaldin SHL I see the next decade moving us forward with how we partner to create great buildings in the real world. We will start to provide construction instructions for robots as much as humans who will be doing the work. This will necessitate that we start creating true digital twins and allow for artificial intelligence to figure out the best means and methods by which objects and systems get built.   We will have to double down on our digital literacy in order to have even higher levels of accuracy in our digital information. Matt Petermann Digital Practice I see a leveling of the field. Renderings are not done by that one person who knows how to render. Real time render software like Enscape allows anyone to not just walk the model, but to render countless renderings in real time. Access to data from the model is no longer limited to those using Revit. BIM 360 allows all stake holders the ability to access the model. Client’s are no longer forced to understand design via abstract 2D drawings or fixed point perspectives. VR allows them to immerse themselves and “get it”. Computational and generative design are no longer relegated to the office coder. Apps like Dynamo Player and Autodesk Refinery are opening up automation and iterative design to all designers. And this is at the beginning of 2020. Just where we’ll be 10 years from now is anyone’s guess, but one can’t help but feel optimistic about a future where all levels of technology begin to be accessible to all. Damian Ponton Miami Studio I think the biggest change in how we deliver for clients will be surrounding BIM as a deliverable. Despite all the technology at our hands, our industry is still crippled by the paper drawing set deliverable. With Design Assist contractor and fabricator relationships, we might be at the dawn of Model deliverables for Construction. Daniel Prager Chicago Studio I believe the biggest change in how we deliver our designs for clients will be in the design tools we use, the way we communicate these designs and the data exchange platforms that we work with. Even though we are only now seeing slow advances in interoperability between software, I’d like to think of tools as light weight and effective at freeform modelling as rhino but with the data and parametric capabilities of Revit. The outputs from these super tools would live in a decentralised, agnostic web based platform, connected to live data inputs from the ever changing physical world. It may also be that every designer has a virtual design assistant validating design ideas using AI and generative design processes. London Studio I foresee the evolutionary change where architectural design will be supplemented by AI checking codes, running rapid design iterations for optimization, and creating documentation for construction, which will become almost completely automated as well. There will be a focus on adaptive reuse of existing buildings in large cities, economic and efficient transportation for individuals. People will telecommute with much richer interactive experience (holograms?). Office space might become a virtual hangout, and architects will be busy re-purposing all the office space to other uses. Helen Gorina Digital Practice One area that I have taken a keen interest in over recent years is how our designs will be communicated as technology advances. With VR having only limited “experience” use case in our workspace, it is AR that will increase an expand. Some of the tools and AR-capable devices that have been proposed for more than a decade as becoming the norm, may finally realise the promise of now being only a few years away from mainstream. AR will assist us with design verification, making it simple to see how a variety of design options may impact the end user, town planning approval process, construction site or operations team, especially when lightweight hardware comes coupled with the Invisibility cloak… Jordan Lane London Studio The next decade will mainstream the digital technology that picked up momentum in the late 10’s. We will see multiple variations of interactive modeling, implementation of digital documentation and AR, while countless options of generative design tools will assess the design problematics to ease some of our decision making. However as large sets of data will be collected and worked upon, I believe that the very big change is none of the above, rather “to whom and what” will we design for? What shall the designers be designing when clients, developers, municipalities, etc, can themselves “layout the cards” and use the same design tools as previously only “specialists” could interact with? I guess that a true transformation of the future architectural practice will start with the digital services focusing on gathering data related to building performance (materials, environment, maintenance, etc) and most importantly, human behavior and the true usage of space. These will inform upfront the next design model, truly based on data evidence and no longer preaching empirical design approaches. But once all AI&ML is mainstreamed, and fully implemented Digital Fabrication and robotics is a reality, when all sectors of society will be affected by tremendous efficiencies, where will (especially but not exclusively) the blue collar worker be spending their time, now that this workforce became redundant? How will this affect work-life-leisure as we know it, with focus on those that are more vulnerable to the next generation technology taking over their jobs? So what shall we be designing, and to whom are we designing for? Tiago Pereira SHL",

    "content": "Wrong Node Alert i s a Perkins&Will Revit tool that alerts the user when they open a revit file on the wrong node. (Updated 1/28/2020) The term “Wrong Node” means a user opening a Revit project on a node machine that does not match the city where the project file server is residing in. For example opening a Boston project (P:\\Boston\\…\\Project.rvt), on a New York Node (NYOCN0204) would cause the wrong node alert to pop up and suggest that you log into the Boston node to work on the Boston project file. Or anyone of these other conditions: Opening a Project Cloud project on your local laptop instead of PWC nodes. Opening a project on a thin client (not an MSI laptop) Opening a project outside the office (offsite) The reason we care when a user is using the wrong node is because wrong node can causes some serious problems including: Slow performance: It takes longer to load a Boston file from NYO than it is to load a Boston file from Boston. Delay: Saving and synching to central may take longer than normal when working remotely. File Corruption: the delay in performance often causes corruption in the Revit file integrity, which will lead to unpleasant error message and major headaches for the project team down the road. Clearly, no one wants to corrupt their Revit project file. Often this happens unintentionally as people work on multiple projects from different offices and forget to change the node as they swtich between projects. They may have saved a few minutes for themselves from not changing the nodes, but as they corrupted the file by working on the wrong node, the team will have to pay for it by losing many more hours of work just to fix those errors. The moral of the story is don’t work on the wrong node, always match the node city with the project city and you will work smoother, be happier and live longer! What do I do if I see the Wrong Node Alert? If you see the wrong Node Alert. just Stop, Close and Change Node . Stop what you are doing. Close the Revit file. Log into the matching city Node (Open New York file on New York Node, Boston file on Boston Node, ProjectCloud on Project Cloud Nodes.etc.) Just as a precaution, an alert message will be sent to the Design Application Manager of the office that are affected by your action. You might be getting a call from them soon. Options Close All Documents and Exit Revit : When only 1 document is open, you will see the option to close all and exit Revit. This option will prompt you to save and exit Revit automatically. Close and Continue : This option will close the pop up window, send an alert to the DA, and let you continue as normal. When more than 1 document is open, this will be the only option given to you, since we don’t want to force you to close up any other Revit document that is still open. Kindly close the offending Revit file, and log into the proper matching node to re-open the Revit file on the correct node. Read More : Read more will bring you to this page on the pulse! What if I just need to copy a detail from my other project? Question : I’m working on the right city node, but I just need to copy a small detail from my other project that is not in this city’s projects, do I still need to change node? Answer : In this case, you can open the other project by detaching it, and that will avoid any problem from corrupting the other project file! and the Wrong Node Alert will ignore all detached file opening events. Note: Wrong Node Alert will only be installed for Revit 2018, 2019, and 2020",

    "content": "Perkins&Will is known for our projects taking advantage of creative use of design technology, visualization, analysis, and automation. This year many projects benefited from advanced use of technology,  with our experts blazing the trail and disseminating know-how to the teams. We are proud to present several outstanding solutions implemented on the projects this year. Rapid design iterations with automatic documentation CHoP PAOB, New York Studio EXTERIOR DESIGN TEAM Rob Goodwin; Sean Erickson; Emma Peng; Eric Baker; Dahmahlee Lawrence COMPUTATIONAL TEAM Helen Gorina, Dahmahlee Lawrence CHoP PAOB  project utilized  computational approach using system of adaptive components for rapid design iterations of gradated curtain-wall. This approach allowed the team to quickly generate and study various design options and solve many design challenges. In addition, this approach allowed us automate the documentation, so instead of painstakingly re-dimensioning every time we adjust our design, we used much more efficient method: documenting with schedules. Computational design team: Helen Gorina (Digital Practice) and Dahmalee Lawrence (NY Studio). More details about this project challenges and solutions can be found here To see recorded session, click here (the project starts on 24th minute) Helen Gorina Digital Practice Extra Large Project Set Up MQCC Vancouver studio BIM planning for mega projects is always specialized due to the number of components and duration of projects. The key to breaking them down lies in finding simplicity within the chaos and complexity. Well documented processes help communicate to large teams the method in which they are to work. The framework must be robust enough to anticipate and adjust for change, as it is inevitable. The presentation of the Coquitlam Centre project walks through the set up and principles by which the team is working large scale and on tight and demanding deadlines. I expected change as a constant from the onset of this project. We went from 10 towers to 9 right from the start. The most surprising thing was how many times levels changed. The are roughly 500 levels in the project and they have been shifting up and down, sometimes daily, to handle the client’s changing demands. The system put in place has been robust enough that there have not been any major issues with the models. Eli Wolpin Senior Architect, Vancouver This workflow will be presented live on Thursday February 14 on a firm wide Design and Delivery eXchange conference call.

Over the years, architects’ toolsets have evolved—from paper, pens, and rulers to modeling clay, scanners, and hot-wire cutters. While many of the tools and processes have changed, one thing has remained the same: architects build a physical model of the design before creating the final product. But what if you could feed your digital design to a small robotic arm equipped with all the tools necessary to bring your physical model to fruition? A researcher at Perkins&Will has created just that—the Mobile Robotic Assistant for Architectural Design (MRAAD, for short).

    "content": "Through the fall and into the winter many design applications have been updated. These updates include new releases with new functionality to bug fixing. Below are a few of the most notable updates. Whats new in Revit In addition to scaled up piloting of BIM 360 , many third party tools were updated to be compatible with BIM 360 and Revit 2020 . We continue improving our content libraries hosted on HIVE , and the latest enhancements to HIVE will allow content managers to distribute saved searches to their teams and studios, which will make search even more efficient. Additionally, to further  streamline the search we are consolidating versions – specific Revit libraries , but do not worry: the content will be filtered automatically to “sense” the current version of Revit you are using. There upgrades should be completed by the end of December. Whats new in Rhino 6 The long beta period is over: Grasshopper is now a full-fledged part of Rhino. Grasshopper provides the solid foundation for many incredible third-party components ranging from environmental analysis to robotic control.  Bundled with Rhino 6 is the same Grasshopper you have been using, plus many enhancements. It is compatible with existing components and includes new ones out of the box. This version also has improved visualization workflows – major changes to Rendering, Materials and presentation tools. Display system can now take advantage of modern graphics hardware, display speed can be up to 300% faster. And as always some bugs are squashed and glitches resolved. Whats new in Enscape v 2.5 Many of our designers use real-time visualization feedback of Enscape. The latest upgrade to v. 2.5 brings more features: Expanded web based asset library – free and very realistic. New material editing options, Video Editor improvements  and many other enhancements. Whats new in Lumion 10.0 In this release Lumion users will find many improved features . The top three are: High-quality preview feature can help save you from the guesswork when going through the render editing process, while giving you more confidence when setting up the lighting, weather, shadows, materials and photo compositions. WATCH Fin e-detail nature models – Containing 62 tree and plant species, these nature models are high-polygon, finely detailed trees and plants designed for close-up views and for the foreground of your images and videos. WATCH Displacement mapping – to 167 materials. With the movement of a slider, you can adjust the depth and geometry of the selected material, giving it a realistic, three-dimensional look and feel.

    "content": "This year Autodesk attracted over 12,000 attendees to its annual design technology conference held in Las Vegas. The four day event covers many facets of architecture, engineering and construction technologies as well as media [think Hollywood cg] and manufacturing. The week packs in a tremendous number of demo’s, keynotes, presentations, round-table discussions and a expo floor full of various technology vendors. Autodesk leverages the conference to message what new technology is being developed on their road-map as well as reading the proverbial tea leaves for 2020 and beyond. Perkins&Will had over 10 speakers covering topics from robotic construction to cinematography techniques and were joined by colleagues from across our studios. Now we want to share what we learned, saw and thought you should know about from the pre-conference sessions to the keynote to the last day, when everyone is running on coffee. Below are the key takeaways from those who attended. “I went to Autodesk University wondering if Perkins&Will was at the forefront of technology. After attending several sessions with leading firms presenting their strategies and challenges, I discovered that we are in fact at the forefront through our use and research into Generative Design and Robotics. There are clear challenges all firms are facing when integrating multiple software such as Revit and Rhino. This will continue to be a challenge until there is a streamlined process for them to interact in dual directions. Where we can improve, is in the use of tools to both speed up work and do away with the mundane. Dynamo is critical in this task and must be more widely used to automate processes. Keyboard shortcuts can also speed up work, as demonstrated in one course, by more than 50%. Automation will allow us to be more efficient and let us focus on the design rather than the mundane.” Eli Wolpin Vancouver Studio “I attended the Forge DevCon pre-conference where I was excited about the potential to build custom applications and interfaces over BIM 360 using the Forge platform . I was particularly interested in the use of gaming engines such as Unity and Unreal to streamline the process of going from BIM 360 to AR and VR. Autodesk demonstrated the Forge AR|VR Toolkit which provides a set of APIs to develop custom augmented and virtual reality experiences, while Unity previewed their soon to be released Unity Reflect real-time 3D app. I also attended a few developer workshops that walked through the process of developing on the Forge platform. “ Razan Altiraifi Washington DC Studio / Digital Practice ” There were many excellent classes about BIM 360 efficiencies, best practices, management and troubleshooting. If you are new to BIM 360, I recommend this detailed overview . I also recommend two classes for BIM360 users who want to improve their productivity and troubleshoot  BIM 360 problems .” Helen Gorina New York City Studio / Digital Practice “This was my first time attending Autodesk University and in all reality, I didn’t know what to expect. I filled my schedule with classes that I thought would help me and the studio streamline the process that we currently have in place with regards to document management during Construction Administration.  With Autodesk’s recent acquisition of Plan Grid a class that I found interesting and that could benefit Perkins&Will, is the Integration of BIM 360 and Plan Grid .  I am currently working on a project where the General Contractor is using Plan Grid and we are using BIM 360 so having the ability to push field observation reports directly to the GCs Plan Grid account would facilitate in tracking any field deficiencies that arise through the construction process. Another takeaway from AU is that virtual reality keeps having a major presence and finding the correct platform to best communicate with clients is a challenge. BIM 360 VR Collaboration with Insite VR takes the traditional 11×17 room data sheets out of the equation and allows owners to make immediate markups in VR, publish “issues” and have them available to the design team live on the cloud. I am fortunate to have Rachel Gruber in the Dallas Studio who has worked closely with Insite VR to implement this powerful tool in her projects, can’t wait to implement this on my future projects.” Francisco Velasquez Dallas Studio ” This class, Dynamo from BIM Automation to Generative Design , really opened my eyes to what’s possible. The examples we got to play with would be very beneficial to the CCC team for massing. In addition, Project Refinery would benefit our CI team for layout options. The generative design workflows they shared with us are pushing the threshold on what’s possible in the early stages of design.” Stephen Grant Austin Studio / Digital Practice “The Mercedes Benz EQ House by the Japanese firm Takenaka Corporation was an amazing example of a project encapsulating the latest technologies in all phases of design, construction and occupancy. Plus it was designed and built in under a year” Dean Demko LA Studio / Digital Practice “I was happy to see Virtual Reality being used to teach ADA codes and create empathy in designers by the firm Shepley Bulfinch. Arkio is making advances in the field of modeling using Virtual Reality. I attended a demo where they demonstrated how multiple people can be simultaneously immersed in the same environment, all modeling at the same time. The live demo of Twinmotion blew my mind with how quickly one can populate an entire scene in real time, including high quality landscaping, weather effects, and entourage. Damian Ponton Miami Studio / Digital Practice “Autodesk University brings out the very best when it comes to technology for the AEC industry. It was thrilling to experience firsthand all the new advances in real-time visualization efforts, improvements in production workflows and efficiencies, innovative approaches to creative problem solving, and motivating lectures given by industry heavyweights.  I was pleasantly surprised to learn more about a new workflow between Civil 3d and Revit, which has tremendous potential to save us time by leveraging data we traditionally don’t consume. Geolocation, topography, survey points, and integration into the BIM 360 cloud are now being streamlined and integrated into the Revit workflow. The days of geometry exceeding 20km are limited! This is something to get excited about! “ Tyler Ostrozynski Dallas Studio “It was refreshing to know how much further along Perkins&Will is with integrating BIM360 into our design process. At the same time, I appreciated the other firms tips and tricks on utilization. I walked away with a great deal of knowledge on how to better take advantage of some of the tools.” Justin Benjamin Washington DC Studio / Digital Practice “The Design Automation API for Revit is a new set of tools that allows users to open, view and edit a Revit model in the cloud. Yes, somebody without Revit software, or the skills to use it, can access and change the linked database that gets updated in a Revit model. It is a very cool concept, and we will see some exciting new tools come from it.” David Sewell London Studio / Digital Practice “It was evident that the “Real-Time” battle for the AEC market is in full force. Unity, backed by Autodesk, has made significant improvements with Unity Reflect.  Twinmotion now has the power of Epic Games with plans to allow a back-and-forth workflow with Unreal Engine. Enscape and Lumion continue to move forward with frequent updates. One class that had me thinking was “Making Game Engines Work for Engineers”.  Before you write this one off, the topic was about using the game engine for more than just visualization.  It focused on the unique point of view that can be created in the “game” as well as the robust physics system that can be utilized.” Justin Cooper Atlanta Studio “I spent the majority of my time in the Expo hall meeting with existing Hardware vendors, like MSI and potential new partners. Spending time with experts and newer hardware, can really speed up an understanding of how this hardware would integrate into our platform. The expo also offers a bit of a crystal ball as to what we may be seeing in the not too distant future.” Gerald Van Benschop Houston Studio / Global Technology Services “After working with Angel Say at InsiteVR for months testing their new software with the Oculus Quest, it was great to finally meet him in person and demo the new updates they were testing at AU. Using Virtual Reality for Knowledge Transfer and Teaching Empathetic Design looked at using VR to train architects what accessible spaces feel like that the differences between the different codes. And Augmented Reality: Speeding Up Field Verification and Communication was a create case study on using the Microsoft HoloLens in the field for construction verification and site visits. The entire experience makes the future of our industry seem so much closer and you can’t help but be excited for it.” Rachel Gruber Dallas Studio “The Forge DevCon exhibited some incredibly interesting developments. Two of note were a custom application to integrate BIM 360 with ARKit which streamlined creating USDZ models directly from Revit models. USDZ’s are super cool because they’re a easy way to jump into AR from any iOS device. Another cool development is that Autodesk is looking to make creating Forge applications a bit more user friendly by creating nodes for Node-RED which is a visual scripting platform very similar to Grasshopper and Dynamo. This will allow non-programmers to create pretty advanced, bespoke tools that integrate directly with BIM 360!” Mario Romero Chicago Studio / Digital Practice “I have two main highlights for AU 2019.  The first is the all-day Dynamo for Software Developers workshop, where we used Python and C# to manipulate geometry and data within Revit.  We also used C# to create a simple Add-in on the tab within Revit.  I had some experience with scripting in the past, but this workshop definitely challenged me.  The second highlight was Custom Computational & Cloud-Enabled Workflows for BIM Design Implementation, which was presented by Eckart Schwerdtfeger (BIM specialist from Zaha Hadid Architects).  This guy blows my mind every year, and did not disappoint this time around.  He was sending tasks to the cloud that would take a panel assembly created by Rhino/Grasshopper and create a revit file with the same assembly, but with native revit adaptive component families.  He was using Forge and cloud services to do other things, like print a PDF set.  He used an Amazon go button to print PDFs.  Then, he used Siri on the iPhone to create a PDF task to print a sheet set from Revit.  Amazing stuff!” Jason Diamond Atlanta Studio / Digital Practice",

    "content": "‘Increasingly we need ways of differentiating us from our competitors. This was a tough pursuit where quality of design and our approach to co-creation really won the day. Having the ability to share our design proposals with a large group of people and invite comments showed our digital innovation.’ Linzi Cassels, Principal, Design Director We were recently shortlisted on a large scale Interior Design project for EBRD’s new headquarters in Canary Wharf London. The last stage of the pitch was to compete against the other chosen design firms in providing a full concept design of the buildings interior, taking into account EBRD’s core values. The final presentation was to be exhibited over a 5 day period to allow as many members of EBRD’s staff as possible to review and engage with the scheme but also provide valuable feedback to both the designers and EBRD’s senior management. The presentation space itself was restricted to a maximum of 18sqm with the team electing to use 10No 2000mm x 610mm vertically hung boards and a LCD screen (Just for good measure everything also had to be fireproofed!) With a tight deadline, the team worked into the small hours over the space of the week and with the presentation material being finalized, the challenge of reaching an audience past exhibition area footfall, was met with the idea of packaging the entire scheme into a digital wrap via a bespoke PW project website and VX app. With only a one day timeframe…… it was time to call the Viz Lab hotline. Following a flurry of emails, phone calls and frantic instant message chat between the newly formed “digital content team” late one evening, ideas were shared, a brief given and a plan formed. The result 24 hours later – • One Branded Website – Click to Preview • One VX Project App •   Completed in One Day •   With only O ne evening’s notice, by Andrea Manzano from the VIZLAB. In addition to the physical material boards being embedded into the website as separate web-pages the site also featured a feedback page and received a large number of responses and website hits. We know we reached those that hadn’t maybe seen the physical exhibition space as EBRD staff had asked for links to share with others. Staff Feedback Staff Feedback Feedback was good, QR codes were scanned, headsets worn and websites visited which all helped communicate a very strong design idea. So, what happened, how did it go ? … Well we only went and won it ! Contracts have been signed and it’s now time to get on with the task ahead but team feedback was good.  Not only did the digital content help communicate the design and reach a wider audience but it’s often a real differential. Our interior design competitors in London just do not have the resource of the Perkins&Will’s digital practice team and tapping into this is something we are striving to use much more to our advantage. Final “Pitch Space” As I’m part of the Digital Practice team I am obviously a little bias in all of this but I do appreciate it might not be the sole reason for us winning the project………….. so see below for some feedback quotes from those who were part of the presentation/exhibition team. ‘Our digital tools are such a useful part of the design and communication journey on live projects. It was excellent to be able to start the journey at pitch stage for EBRD; ultimately it was part of our success.’ Joelle Laney, Senior Associate My final mention goes to my fellow members of the 24 hour digital content team, Joelle Laney (senior designer), Charlotte Nash (senior bid coordinator) and Andrea Manzano (VIZLAB) along with a thanks to Nick Cameron for help pulling the strings to make it happen. We are already sharing more ideas to deliver richer outputs, improve end user experience and create locally managed templates as we see this material becoming business as usual on must win presentations. Hopefully more will follow, so watch this (web)space…. Digital Practice can help shape projects from bid to handover so I’d always suggest reaching out to those associated folks in your offices. We have access to so much resource and may even offer new ideas, processes and solutions that are just a little different to those tried and tested old school methods, they may even assist you winning a project.",

    "content": "The Software Games If the movies The Hunger Games & Karate Kid had a baby, the result would be The Software Games. What is it? Why do it? How were you able to pull it off? Who is Jordan Hanson? These are all great questions and I can appreciate the enthusiasm. If you are familiar with who I am (the Justin Benjamin), you know how well I can get to the point quickly… 😉 Bare with me as I attempt to tackle explaining what could possibly replace the Olympics (this is quite the exaggeration… but my heart was in the right place when I decided to make the comparison). The What. Consider “Trivia night” at your local watering hole. It’s success is likely tied to its social atmosphere (ie bonding with peers), a taste of competition (ie teamwork), a thirst for knowledge (ie training) and then a sprinkle of some type of monetary incentive (ie bribery). Now aside from the bribery (which still plays a part), the remaining reasons make for an ideal company outing… In a nutshell, that is the atmosphere we are shooting for when it comes to The Software Games. We just focus less on history/pop culture fun facts, and more on design application utilization. The Why. The Software Games is an effort developed in our New York office as an alternative form of training. Instead of rambling on about the importance of implementation as it relates to all of our innovations and application acquisitions. I will assume we can all agree that a strategy for rolling out the new tool is critical and this strategy will always incorporate training… Video tutorials are rarely watched. Documentation is rarely resourced proactively. Pushing staff into a room with me for multiple days as I run through Revit exercises… Well, that is just mean. The How. There are 4 rounds (1 task is created for each round). Rounds are 5 minutes long (the complexity of each task reflects the allotted time – contestants should have a reasonable chance in completing the task). Come game night, the audience is asked for volunteers (4 people can play per round). Those volunteers sit at one of the prepared laptops. All laptops are projected to a common screen for audience enjoyment. The MC makes them aware of the task and then calls it… Ready. Set. Go! *If staff proved reluctant to volunteer when asked, the offices DTLs were made aware of their forced participation… Just to get the ball rolling. That said, it wasn’t necessary to call upon them! The Result. Our first competition was focused around Affinity (lending to the title The Software Games: Affinity War). It was deliberately chosen because of the lack of adoption ‘Affinity Photo’ has gotten since Perkins&Will adopted the software in December 2018. Knowing that our office had many people confident in their photo editing skills, but lacked the basic knowledge of this program, made it a prime candidate for our first competition. The excitement during the competitions created a huge crowd to gather from the office to watch and support their peers. This setup allowed the competitors to learn the software, but gave the audience glimpses into the many different techniques that could be used to solve the challenges. Everyone Wins! Upon each rounds completion, the MC will review aloud the work completed by each contestant. He will ask for audience applause to help with any tough decisions. Prizes are awarded as follows: Was the task completed (minimum requirements)? Yes = $10 Amazon Who did the best job? 1 Person awarded another $10 Amazon Did you participate? No tangible prize is given, but respect from your peers for trying… That is priceless. Oh yeah, you also likely picked up a skill from having tried. SHOUT OUT TO OUR FIRST “THE SOFTWARE GAMES” WINNERS! The Future. We intend to do a couple more games internally (office specific). Once the kinks are worked out, we are going national. Washington DC… NY is coming for you next. As for the rest of the studios… Come time you are called upon… Are you going to be ready? Or are you going to be scared? The Software Games. Come Compete. Come Watch. Come Learn. Jordan Hanson? Aspiring Architect. Lead DTL. Adequate ping pong player (yet to beat me… its adorable). It was his attendance at Pixels of Fury that proved to be the foundation (architectural pun intended) for what we now refer to as The Software Games. Thank you Jordan (sorry about the ping pong player comment…)",

    "content": "Visualization is always critical for design concepts’ delivery. To assist clients and consultants in better understanding our design ideas, Shanghai office is pushing forward different kinds of visualization applications. On October 10th, we launched our first VR presentation with clients and consultants for Suzhou Science and Technology Museum’s CD discussion. Suzhou STM is a collaboration project between Chicago and Shanghai office with emphasizes on Suzhou’s long historical use of silk. Its detailed facade design was completed through rhino and grasshopper using computational design tools (To learn more about this computational design, please refer to this article: Suzhou Science + Technology Museum – Weaving A Complex Facade ). Below are some pictures showing this project. Due to the complexity of facade and lack of BIM tools from structural engineers, clash detection was performed relatively late and there were a numbers of clashes between architectural and structural models which would need deep and complex modifications. On our side, we would like to keep our architectural facade consistent along the whole design process. Therefore, in order to give our clients, structural engineers and other consultants a more intuitive feeling of the actual space, we invited them to our office for an immersive VR trip inside our architectural working model. Facade patterns and materials (except glasses) were all removed to focus only on shape and space feelings, as shown in the GIF below. Examples of Scenes Showing to Clients We were pleased to see that everyone in the meeting really enjoy this VR tour. Both clients and structural engineers complimented the space feeling a lot and demonstrated that this kind of presentation gave them an unprecedented and direct perception about the whole project. They were always questioning that level heights might be a little bit low; but while experiencing in real scale, level heights seem to be exactly as they want. Our designers also had a chance to discuss specific curtain details with curtain consultants while walking through the entire project. The overall feedback from this first VR presentation is pretty positive. With these positive results, Shanghai office is also considering moving VR equipment to our largest meeting room permanently for a convenience to provide these kind of presentation more.",

SPEED is a web-based and cloud-based energy/daylighting/solar design and simulation platform for early design we developed for architects enabling a 1-day turn-around from design question to a data-driven design answer. SPEED is particularly useful for when you don’t yet have a mechanical or energy consultant, or do but budget and schedule constraints prevent them from meeting your project needs. You can quickly create a project, run shading and solar studies in seconds, run a parametric study with hundreds or thousands of design options on the cloud in a matter of hours including statistical analysis, and interactively visualize the results and compare them against your project’s EUI benchmarks and targets. We hope that you will start using SPEED immediately on your project work since it is available to everyone at the firm right now, it is free for everyone to use, and it was developed in house with the firm’s design and sustainability goals in mind.

    "content": "MassFormer exports directly to BIM360 In mid-September, Perkins&Will’s developer team participated in the Autodesk Forge Accelerator in New York City. Our four person developer team consists of Satya Basu, Iffat Mai, Matt Chan and Chan Youn. This was a joint effort between our Digital Practice Group and i/o Team to integrate our cloud based planning tool known as Massformer with the Revit software, more specifically to create a direct link between Massformer with the cloud version of Revit also known as BIM360. The Forge Accelerator was a special event hosted by the Autodesk’s Forge team to work with their clients and third-party developers to accelerate their development of cloud applications using the Forge API. Tasked with the mission to build the next generation of apps and tools, our team worked with Autodesk Forge experts for most of the week and successfully developed a Forge tool that connects our planning tool , Massformer, directly to BIM360 in the cloud. The Forge Accelerator in New York City was the first one held in New York by Autodesk. With over a dozen of companies participating in this event. Participants included many Architectural and Engineering firms (such as Woods Bagot and SHoP Architects), Contractors, Vendors, BIM consultants and other AEC services and software developers.  As more and more of our AEC data and applications are moving into the cloud, the new frontier for the AEC industry is clearly focused on Cloud Computing. Our custom tools needed to follow the movement and transition into the cloud platform as part of our migration to the cloud. All the companies attending the Forge Accelerator came with a proposed project that involved using Forge API to create the new tools needed to optimize their workflow with BIM360. Linking MassFormer with BIM360 was our team’s mission. Massformer is our web-based tool designed by Perkins&Will’s i/o team. As an early planning tool, Massformer is designed to give our designers a simple tool to create building massing, programming, space calculation and design options without having to know how to operate in Revit. However, in order to make this tool truly useful for our designers, Massformer needed to integrate downstream with our standard design software such as Revit and BIM360. Our goal was to create an easy button that will automatically export Massformer’s building data and geometry and recreate them as a Revit file with native Revit walls and floors, so the rest of the team can access it through BIM360 in the cloud. All this was accomplished by leveraging the power of Forge API. Our developers created a custom library (.DLL) that reads in our building data from MassFormer as JSON files. Then using the Forge Design Automation API for Revit, which was still in beta at that time, we were able to automate the data creation inside Revit as native Revit objects. All the process is taken care of in the cloud. Once the conversion process is complete, the user receives a notification with a link to download the Revit file, or to view the file in the Forge Viewer and has access to the 3D model and floor plans in BIM360. After this experience working at the Forge Accelerator, our developer team is confident that we will be able to further develop other tools that can help our teams to integrate with BIM360 with more ease and efficiency.

    "content": "Markups in BIM360 Over the life of a project, we spend a great amount of time working with PDF files from troubleshooting failed Clarity tasks to sending marked up PDFs via email to team members.  What if you never had to worry about these files, and the creation, opening, or saving of these?  What if you never had to look through your emails to find that PDF markup?  All of these activities have no real impact on your project, yet they consume a valuable commodity: time.  With using BIM360, no one has to organize and manage where the markups are located.  The markups always live with the project in the cloud and are accessible to all project team members. In addition, this workflow eliminates any PDF printing issues because there is no PDF to print.  Creating markups in the BIM360 viewer is intuitive, simple, and can streamline communication to the project team in a very transparent way. To create a markup, you will need to be logged into your BIM360 project in the web browser.  Within the Document Management module, navigate to the Revit file that contains the published sheets, and click on it.  This will open a viewer that displays all the published sheets and 3D views for that file.  As a side note, publishing 3D views from your cloud models is a great way to track progress or communicate changes of complex design components that can be otherwise difficult to explain with 2D drawings. Using the markup tools on the right side of the browser, you can place text, clouds, dimensions, and draw lines/shapes.  All line-based markup elements can vary in color and thickness.  Any closed shapes in the markups (rectangles, clouds, etc.) can have a fill color with options to change the opacity.   Also, there are text controls for font size, color, line thickness, and fill color/opacity.  When your markup is complete, click the Save Markup button.  Any other team member that looks at the sheet will be able to see the markup. Now that you know how to create simple markups without needing a PDF file, the real power comes with attaching that markup to an Issue in BIM360, which will assign it to project team members and establish a due date.  Project team members will automatically receive an email when they have been assigned to an issue.  On the Project Home page in BIM360, each team member will see any issues that have been assigned to them along with the due date.  You can think of these issues as an ongoing to-do list.  When the change has been completed, the reviewer can mark the issue as closed, which will remove it from their to-do list.  With using markups (and issues) on BIM360, collaboration has never been this easy.",

    "content": "In architecture, we often need to lead the clients through our proposed design and get their feedback on what works and what needs to change. Traditionally, we walk them through a series of plans, sections and elevation drawings. Rachel Gruber from our Dallas Office, did just that recently with her healthcare clients, except she led the group through the space in Virtual Reality. After a series of traditional Design Development user meetings, the project team let them experience the space in person but as a group together in the Virtual World. Taking advantage of InsiteVR’s Oculus Quest study offer, the team was able to introduce multi-user Virtual Reality (VR) technology into their healthcare project and use VR to engage their healthcare clients, especially the ones that are not architecturally trained. In Healthcare, it is important to engage the doctors and nurses, who are primary users of the spaces. However, doctors and nurses are not architecturally trained, and they often have a hard time understanding the plans, sections and elevation drawings presented to them. Using VR devices, the users can experience the space immersively. Instead of the traditional single user VR experience where only one person gets to experience VR while others are stuck in 2D, the Oculus Quest in conjunction with InsiteVR allows multiple users to meet in a VR space. As they walk through the space with their peers in the virtual world, they can see and hear their peers talking and moving in the VR world, they can even chat and interact with each other. Suddenly, the VR experience feels even more realistic and less intimidating. Using the VR Group Experience, the team was able to effectively engage up to 5 end users at a time and expedite the client review and sign off process. When Rachel heard about InsiteVR BIM360 study, she was intrigued to participate since her team was already using BIM360, and she was hoping that VR could help with communicating to her non-architecturally trained end-user clients. Through the InsiteVR Oculus Quest program, the team received five free sets of the Oculus Quest headsets to use for their project in exchange for feedback on the  VR sessions using InsiteVR. Since the project team was already on BIM360, the team could easily turn their Revit model into a VR experiences with a quick click of a button. The Oculus Quest headset is a standalone, wireless headset that uses the inside out tracking system. It is lightweight, and easy to carry, and much easier to setup than the HTC Vive or Oculus Rift , as it does not require a computer or a tether. This makes it much more user friendly and less daunting for new users.

    "content": "Architectural spaces should connect building occupants with the outdoors and reinforce circadian rhythms through design features that reduce electric lighting and introduce more natural daylight. This module uses Revit to provide accurate performance feedback and visual information for an indication of your design relative to sustainability goals for LEED reporting of Options for Illuminance or Spatial Daylight Autonomy (sDA) and Annual Sunlight Exposure (ASE). Process The general steps to best practices for using the Insight plug-in for daylight design involves the following steps: Optimize the Run Always check the cost estimate generated , if it is significantly higher than 100 credits, notify Digital Practice and Energy Lab to help optimize your model. Use the larger resolution of the 72-inch grid for initial studies, once it is time to submit anything for LEED, then use a 12-inch grid. For 72-inch grid, typical daylight analysis for a given floor costs 0-20 credits, or slighting higher and always less than 100 For 12-inch grid, typical daylight analysis for a given simple floor costs 4-20 credits or slightly higher and always less than 100 Only submit a single floor at a time to see if there are any issues with the model Submit a typical single floor for repeating floors in a tower, high-rise, or mid-rise If there are no model issues, then only submit unique and typical floors for any tower, high-rise, or mid-rise Model Setup Set Model Location Model Contents and Cleanup Create appropriate glazing criteria in the model for TVIS and opaque surfaces performance Select an Analysis with an appropriate grid resolution Run the analysis to create a lighting result of daylighting levels and 3D model with schedules for the floors and the rooms in the model Open the room analysis schedule and verify the regularly occupied rooms to include in the daylighting analysis Generate and View Results to update the lighting analysis design results with your routinely selected regularly occupied rooms Review the analysis with the design team for making decisions to improve the design Set Model Location Verify that the project model location is set and does not have the default city selected.  Check the true north to verify the project true north alignment. Model Contents and Cleanup Our work today usually starts with either model provisioned into links, or there is a plan for the model breakup in the Digital Execution Plan. For daylighting, at a minimum, we must have the rooms and floor in the same model that you will run the daylighting analysis. Often, the rooms reside in the interiors model and the floors in the shell and core model. First, we only work in a detached saved copy of the single Revit model or the interiors model if it is a split model workflow. There are a couple of things that will need to take place that differs from the active production model such as changing the glazing from “Render-Ready” to “Daylighting Design-Ready,” and we must have the rooms and floors in the same model. If you find that your rooms and floors are not in the same model, then it is best to copy and monitor the floors from the shell and core into the interior model after you work in a local copy detached copy of it. In the past, we have attempted use of the “Bind” Revit models but in most cases it fails, and so the best option currently is to copy/monitor the floors. There are a couple of things that will need to take place that differs from the active production model such as changing the glazing from “Render-Ready” to “Daylighting Design-Ready,” The last check you should perform is to make sure you have ceilings, exterior walls, and roofs in a link that you can see and that there no transparent materials applied to any of these elements. The last item is to turn off all light fixtures or disable them appearing in the model from the view visibility settings as these will interfere with the daylighting analysis results. A cursory check and mitigation of the model avoiding misplaced items or elements that block glazing areas, or any other items that will interfere with the daylighting analysis. The model will require at least one level and a “placed” room and floor assembly element for an analysis run. In summary, floors must be modeled in a non-linked reference model with the associated room and not within a group.  The Copy/Monitor feature on a linked floor will work in a model with rooms. Glazing Criteria See the current reference for your Revit version regarding the transparent and opaque material RGB settings and additional instructions. As a first daylight design step, we only work on the glazing settings. The opaque material settings can be left as-is if the interior design specification of materials is present, only consider the step here if you are within a percent or two of your daylighting target as it can be time-consuming. We generally apply the following fundamental light reflectance values below; these can be different pending compliance for Interior Lighting credit option for lighting controls: Ceilings 80% Walls 50% Floors 20% See additional material light reflectance values here: Revit Daylight Glazing Product VLT Calculator Use the resource below to interpolate the best RGB settings between your actual product VLT glazing and the Autodesk Glazing Properties Table. Revit Glazing Properites for Illuminance Renderings Resource Weblink Revit Reflectivity of Opaque Materials for Illuminance Resource Weblink Grid Resolution For your first initial studies, please use a grid resolution of 72-inch grid.  Once it is time to submit anything for LEED, then we can use the 12-inch grid resolution. Daylight Analysis Preparation For your first initial studies, never submit all levels for any daylight analysis. Submit a single floor at a time to see if there are any issues with the model, such as a large ground level floor that may represent landscaping or a parking layout. Autodesk will charge for each analysis a basis of the amount of floor area that you submit. We often use floors for exterior landscape contours. If your project is a tower, high-rise, or mid-rise, then consider only submitting a typical single floor for repeating floors with the necessary documentation in your LEED narrative. For the 72-inch grid analysis, the daylight analysis for a given floor costs about 0-30 credits. For sDA and ASE analysis, the cost is in the higher end of the range. For the 12-inch grid analysis, the daylight analysis for a given floor costs about 4-30 credits. For sDA and ASE analysis, the cost is in the higher end of the range. If you see anything approaching 100 credits or more for a single study, please contact your local DA, Digital Practice, or Energy Lab for additional help for a determination of the high cost before sending the analysis to Autodesk. The analysis credit costs are real dollars that the firm pays so use your professional judgment and the guidance here whenever approving or accepting an analysis cost from Autodesk. The option for spatial daylight autonomy and annual sunlight exposure appear starting in LEED version 4.0 and 4.1.  Energy Lab advises anyone that will consider LEED V4.0 to apply for the V4.1 credit options which are less stringent and may provide a successful path to compliance. Analysis Run Before the first run of any daylighting analysis, your model will not contain any schedules or 2D and 3D model views. Run the analysis with careful credit cost evaluation to create your analysis which includes schedules and the model views Daylighting Schedule Open the room analysis schedules to verify the regularly occupied spaces to include in the daylighting analysis. For verification of which rooms are periodically occupied, you can use a pure determination of a person spending at least one hour a day to consider it as such and reference the following document: Always use the checkbox for “Include in Daylighting” for indicating the regularly occupied spaces in your model.

    "content": "Digital Practice on Microsoft Teams We know things change fast and it is hard to keep up with all technical issues, questions and problems we might encounter with rapidly changing technology and tools.  It has become more important to work as a team not only in projects, but as a extended team across all studios.  The Digital Practice team has begun leveraging Microsoft Teams to stay in touch and answer questions from designers and experts across the firm. Teams is agile, transparent and gets more eyes on challenges quicker. The Digital Practice Microsoft Team is open to everyone at Perkins&Will and you are encouraged to ask questions, bring up concerns and point out technology issues there. In addition we have a Revit tool which will automatically collect troubleshooting information from your Revit session. Updated DP Assist As we are moving to an even more collaborative environment by implementing BIM360 on our projects, we have overhauled and streamlined the DP Assist Tool so it can also support BIM360 projects and is integrated with Microsoft Teams. For 2019 Revit, the tool is located on the Perkins+Will tab, and for 2020, the tab name is shortened to PW. DP Assist collects diagnostic information from the current file and creates a report that can be instrumental in troubleshooting Revit issues. The report is saved to S:\\journals\\_DAAssist folder and can be viewed as needed. Copy of this report is emailed to your office DA so they can see it on their phone. In addition, for BIM360 projects, it pops up a dialog box containing information about the location of collaborators cache, project and file information. It then fires up Microsoft Teams in your browser and connects you to the Digital Practice Channel , where you can ask a question, describe your challenge, add a screenshot and get expert help. If you are on a computational node, stay in the browser, if you are on a laptop, use the Microsoft Teams app. A new microKnowledge button will open the searchable site containing a wealth of information and answers to many of your questions about different applications and workflows. This is a living and breathing repository of knowledge actively maintained by Perkins&Will experts hosted by the Digital Practice team . A new QuickStart button has also been added, this will link you to QuickStart guides , the fastest way to become proficient with new software. Note: Previous versions of the tool had the ability to request Revit Content Assistance. Since HIVE is now our Revit content search and  distribution tool, please use HIVE Content Request tool instead.",

In addition to automating our output tasks like printing, Clarity can also run model comparison reports and/or visualization, run model metrics to help improve the quality and stability of your project models, and automate other tasks using Macros or Dynamo scripts. Clarity will be unavailable during the upgrade process, which begins Friday, September 6th at 9pm Eastern, 8pm Central, 7pm Mountain, 6pm Pacific time and overnight (or into Saturday morning) at our international locations. Please plan accordingly with your project needs. This version of Clarity features many new enhancements including: Functionality with Revit 2020 Updated add a task interface (seen here) Users can request a model files scan from the home page New Transfer Project Standards task Many under the hood speed improvements Microsoft Teams Upload post action to move any tasks files to your teams folder New create task interface In addition to all of those new features and many more that you can view here we have also engaged clarity development to make a connection to our Microsoft Teams folders so you can upload files directly from a clarity task using the Microsoft Teams post action. We have been using Clarity for over 4 years now and it has saved the firm over 350,000 hours which equates to about 42 full-time employees for those 4 years.  Hopefully, this time was repurposed back to design tasks on all those projects by the team. Even with all that time saving we still don’t have all teams taking full advantage of this tool. Please work with your local Design Applications Manager or GTS support to set up your project in clarity is simple.   All you need to tell them in a help request is the path to your central files. After that is completed, it will only take about 10 minutes to get your typical project printing tasks set up and running. Please be aware that this upgrade means that the functionality of clarity will NO LONGER WORK WITH REVIT 2016 PROJECTS. If your project is in 2016 and going to continue on for a good amount of time please coordinate with your local design applications manager and consider an upgrade plan.",

    "content": "Diversity meets Digital The London Diversity and Engagement G roup teamed up with the RIBA schools programme to work with a n East London school , George Green ’s School to help promote Architecture and Interior Design to the local area. Students were tasked with “ Project PW ” a refur bishment project of our own current London office building . The briefing document included the high-level project vision, client team, project constraints and expectations . Project brief – “Redesign the building (externally and internally). The design must include at least 2 of the following functions: Space to rest Space to eat and drink Space to work Space for entertainment Space for recreation ” The project had a n intense 6-week programme with interim design development workshops where the students met the “Client team” to explain ideas and get design sign off Project Timeline The final presentation and awards ceremony took place in our conference area space with a panel consisting of both Architects and Interior designers where s tudents of Year 9 and 10 ( 13-14 year olds) presented their works. Full House Awards were selected from a variety of categories with all trophies and medals produced by our model shop with one being fabricated live as the students arrived . Awards Following on from the critique and awards ceremony we gave the students a tour of the office and allowed them to road test some of the t ools we use to help us deliver our designs . We set up a Tech Lab in the C onference Rooms and gave the kids access to some of the Digital Hardware we use to enhance our design process. We were initially told 35 students or less would be joining the final presentation at our office prior to the visit. However, in total 60 students turned up after we mentioned that various XR experiences w ould be made available in our office on visiting day! W e also discovered that they are being taught to design using tools such Revit as part of their curriculum. ( Hmmmm … when can they legally start work ? ) Tech Lab The lab consisted of 2 fully immersive fixed VR set up s 1 HoloLens One high end laptop with Xbox controller iPads with built in Interactive AR apps Multi – User Oculus G o ’s Lightweight VR PW’s VX App QR Codes on images and drawings. We were showing a series of projects at various stages on all of the hardware solutions to give the students an idea of how technology can help and enhance the design process. The students (and just as enthusiastically teachers ! ) got heavily involved in fully immersing themselves and naturally seemed to pick up the controls and wander around projects with minimal guidance. This contrasts with many of our clients who shy away from headsets and lean towards the less intrusive QR code style of communication. T his generation were completely t he opposite. The VX app got a good road test as we had devised a treasure hunt / tour of the Chicago office, but this enthusiasm may have been m ore due to the sweet tasting prizes on offer… The HoloLens was a huge hit , the VR set ups had a constant queue (line) but if ever we needed somebody to navigate a bu il ding design with an Xbox controller th ese kids would be perfect. # Fortnite All of the students walked a series of our project s and the excitement and feedback was excellent. Quotes of – “this is b etter than Minecraft” … . “ J ust how cool is this ? ” … “ W ave to me I can see you” … and “ Mr Sha, can we get this at school ” – W hich turned out to be not just an empty request. The school , following , our workshop , have committed to purchasing a VR set up of their own and we are working with them to get a set up to suit their specific needs and budget. Above all it was a really successful visit, made much more special by the wow factor, excitement and smiling faces of the students as they immersed themselves at 1:1 scale in Architecture and Design. Immersive Juniors The London office is now looking at setting up a partnership with the school with th e plan to run the programme annually with the Year 9 age group. In addition to this , 2 places will be offer ed to Year 10 students for a 2 weeks work experience. The 2020 plan has already started… The final quote from the year head probably best sums up the success of the pilot scheme “ I t has been an amazing experience working with you guys on “ Project PW ” and w e were all (teachers included) blown away by the technology being utilised in design projects at Perkins&Will . T hank you for being so hospitable and we are very much looking forward to the next project and the challenges it brings! ” – Sha Alam Class of 2019 Click here to add your own text",

    "content": "Revit 2020 is scheduled to be available to Perkins&Will on September 7th, 2019 As we move from summer to fall we are happy to make the newest version of our modeling and documentation software available.   While the number one thing we continue to see is the stability and speed of the new product there are many other small features that will make everyone’s life just a little easier. In addition to Revit 2020, we are also making available AutoCAD LT 2020, Navisworks 2020, 3dsMax 2020. You should have a plan to upgrade your project This year, if you are in an active design phase, we are going to strongly encourage you to get upgraded to 2020.  With no training, your team should be able to use all the familiar existing features that Revit has always had.  Here are some of the reasons you should consider upgrading:Our typical C401 contracts compel the consultants to upgrade when we do.You gain efficiency when you take advantage of the latest product new features and bug fixes.Many of our tools only support the latest few versions of software. Don’t get stuck in CA without access to tools like Clarity or CTC Tools.In addition to the Revit 2020 software rollout, the Digital Practice network has been hard at work in several areas to continue to weave design technology into the fabric of the firm . Two main new features that you see here are the option to import a PDF underlay and add a path of travel analysis feature.  When importing a PDF into a 2D view in Revit, you have the ability to snap to the PDF if it is vector based (Not scanned) to help model existing conditions.   The new path of travel feature found on the analyze tab in the interface, helps automate discovering the distance from one point to another and approximate time based on other walking properties of that distance.   Although both of these have some limitations they are a great first step to enable further efficiency and enhance previous workflows. In addition there are many other small improvements to Revit 2020: Copy legend views across sheets Additional enhance filtering improvements for view filters Update to Dynamo included with more stability Create elliptical walls Family instances naming clarity Attach walls dialogue enhancement Expose survey and project base points Striped rows in Editing schedules to better find information In addition there are many small things to make Revit function better with the Autodesk BIM360 platform to host your models in the cloud.  You can read more from Autodesk about 2020 and their first update to Revit. What else do we get from 2020 Autodesk products? The options for importing Revit into 3ds Max 2020 get a significant improvement. There are two new options named “Combine by Revit Category and Revit Material” and “Combine by Revit Family Type and Revit Material”. Importing Revit models with either of these options results in 3ds Max scenes where object organization greatly improves efficiencies around selecting groups of objects needing the same material or identical modifications such as mesh editing, mapping, etc. Combining objects based on both Revit material and Revit category or family type means the imported objects are closely organized in a way many designers prefer. The additional labor some designers spend organizing objects may be eliminated entirely. This also reduces some of the skills needed for taking a Revit model into 3ds Max. This could make 3ds Max a more attractive visualization option for additional designers.

    "content": "Modeling and sketching in virtual reality honors the designer’s\nintuition by capturing gestural lines made in the initial concept stage in a\nway that informs the next iteration of the design process. Forms drawn with\nhand controllers are captured in mid-air in real-time, allowing designers to be\nimmersed in their inspiration. In VR, a designer may literally inhabit their sketches,\nquickly changing the scale of the 3D sketch from fitting in the palm of a hand\nto the scale of a building. This experience of illustrating ideas in virtual reality can\ninstantly capture the designer’s intuition digitally, quantifying each\nkinesthetic motion into a three-dimensional model which can generate metrics\nand serve as a base for design evolution. With two hand-held controllers, a\ndesigner can make use of their body to begin creating diagrammatic concepts,\nworking at both the scales of a tabletop model or at with a 1:1 interaction\nwith the building. The very lines that an architect gesturally sketches at the\nstart of the design process, can be continuously modified both in the virtual\nenvironment and outside of it, with exports directly into a Rhino modeling\nenvironment, preserving layers, colors, scale, and the quality of the line\nitself. Figure 1: Potential uses of emerging technologies in an iterative design process One may\nimagine how this use of Virtual Reality could become embedded in the early\nstages of design and connect to an iterative process. Virtual Reality is commonly\nused for visualization throughout the schematic and design development phases.\nHowever, this emerging technology could also be used in the early concept\nstages of design in the place of representational models. Architects often use physical three-dimensional conceptual models\nto test ideas or communicate their thought process to their team members in a\nvisceral way. At times, these conceptual models can take the form of foam\nblocks stacked together, folded chipboard, or clay manipulations. Outside of\narchitecture, some fields of design have the benefit of working with\npre-determined three-dimensional shapes, such as the use of a mannequin for\nfashion design. The act of pinning onto a volumetric surface allows fabric to\ndrape, react, and self-collide to produce volume in such a way that the\ndesigner can test their complex forms without having to pre-determine a\nstructure to define support. This is not the case in physically manufactured architectural\nconcept models. At times, an architect may want to focus on the development of\na feature element in the design that tests the laws of physics, such as large\ncantilever, a parabolic arch, or a keyhole in the center of the building. In\nphysically building a concept model, the architect would need to neglect the\nprimary focus of the proportion or composition of the featured element and\nfocus on developing from the ground up in order to establish a superstructure.\nIf the architect, instead, choses to purely illustrate their ideas in a two-dimensional\ndrawing, the team then must each have their own interpretation of the mental\nconstruct that is associated with the drawn lines in question. For the architect, digital massing models have become favorable\nfor the ability to express dimensions and preserve the work in a way that can\nbe the starting point for the next phase of design work. However, this method\nis arguably lacking in the gestural qualities that are desirable at the\nconceptual phase of the process. One aim of testing conceptual sketching and\nmodeling in virtual reality is to preserve the three-dimensional play that is\nessential to design exploration while giving the designer absolute freedom to\ncreate, knowing that every effort will be quantifiable, with the ability to\ninform the rest of the design process. The following study evaluates virtual reality modeling software– Gravity Sketch and Mindesk – at the start of the design process for architecture. Both these programs have been used most commonly for the automotive, illustrative and fashion industry.  This study will engage the and architectural designer to sketch and model a building in a virtual reality sketching software which would become exportable to a Rhino / Grasshopper interface. From here, the model could be further developed, tested for basics physics simulation, or linked to a Grasshopper definition. The virtual reality environment becomes a tool yet again for modeling, but this time with greater precision and real-time metrics through the software Mindesk. Here, a live Grasshopper link can be modified by controllers in Virtual Reality which shift the base curves or points that are attractors in the grasshopper definition. The Design\nTest: Through extensive experimentation of the implementation of guides,\ngrids and logic in the realm of Gravity Sketch, I had found a series of\nstrategies which would be beneficial to the design of an object or even at the\nscale of a building. The following is a proposed workflow in Gravity Sketch for\na building design at the initial concept stage. Developing schematic floor plates in the model. Creating the first gestural sketches in the model in three-dimensions. Before beginning to design in Gravity Sketch, it is helpful to have a prepared site model to import into the design environment. Site models that have been previously developed in Rhino or Revit can be imported into the reference assets in Gravity Sketch when saved as OBJ files. Additionally, images can serve as references. These images can be anchored to a plane and become incorporated in the sketch, or remain as hovering items, scaled to the user operating the sketch rather than the objects themselves. Here, a Google Earth image is combined with a site model. Preparing additional metric guidelines not present in the program itself. These grid lines were created in Revit and imported into Gravity Sketch as a static image. Within the modeling tools, there are many which facilitate\northogonal snapping for the design of rectilinear forms. Gravity Sketch has a\ngrid snap tool which allows the designer to snap to points set a custom destiny\nranging from 5 cm to 5 m. If the designer prepares a custom grid-line system or\nproperty line plane as a reference image, it can be used to calibrate the scale\nthe sketch itself and serve as reference through the rest of the process. \nA floor plate surface can be developed through either the surface modeling tool\nwith a flat tension setting, or through a loft between two planar curves. These\nfloor plates can be copied along the grid snapping to develop the general\nmassing of the building. The mass could also have been developed through\nplatonic solids. Here, the layers of Gravity Sketch serve as layers of trace\npaper allowing the designer to produce diagrams of circulation and general\nforms over the context itself. The background layers can be locked, hidden or\nslightly ghosted if need be to allow the designer to direct focus to the\nconceptual sketch. Even at the initial concept stage, the designer can scale the\nsketch to direct eye level. Here, the designer is emphasizing the future\npassageway through the city block with a view onto the park adjacent to the new\nbuilding design. By simply importing an image from Google Earth as a base of\nthe model, the designer can understand neighboring green spaces and street\npatterns in relation to its own site and surrounding buildings. Adjustments to\nthe conceptual sketch can be made in real time based on this eye-level\nexperience. Here, the linework of the concept sketch is preserved, and locked\non a separate layer. The designer can then play with opacities and begin\nworking with the planar NURB-based STROKE tool to develop more intentional\nlines that are based on metric information.  Once the designer has\ndeveloped some outlining strokes and modified some of the shapes of the floor\nplate, she can quickly turn on the relevant layers and scale up to eye level\nonce more to verify that the design decisions being made are adding value to\nthe overall experience. Taking note that this model is facing south-east, the most intense\nof the Florida’s solar direction, the designer uses the flashlight tool to test\nthe solar rotation. Quickly seeing that the facade was too exposed on the\nsouthern side, the designer adds an abstracted overhang to the building to\nshield the large balconies. Curves that are measured with the STROKE tool may\nreference the gridlines that the design had previously set. These curves can be\nplanar and serve as platforms for custom surfaces. The designer can also modify\nprevious locations of floor plates or the shapes themselves through the\nnodes-based editor tool. Each control point or control line can be individually\nshaped with ease to create a custom effect.  Colors are used to\ndistinguish important structural elements from special floors. On the subject of visibility settings, it is possible to move\nobjects from layer to layer to have better control over material\ntransparencies. Materials cannot be automatically set to translucent. However,\nlayers may have a decrease in overall opacity. Here, the designer desired to\nrepresent a translucent screen on the southern side. The standard camera\nsettings have the option to alter the field of view and change the background\nto different colors or event exporting it with a transparency. If desired, the\nflashlight can be used to create shadows. The orthographic views can be\nextracted through the viewer and saved individually from every angle – left,\nright, top and bottom. Testing key views and evaluating privacy from other buildings Additionally, the exposure to perspective views so early in design\nprocess might affect the design proposal. For instance, new residents of a\nhigh-rise building might feel concerned about their privacy with neighbors\nlooking into their home. By entering eye levels of the direct surroundings,\ndesign decisions can be made for the addition of louvers or screens to obscure\ndirect views. When exporting the completed digital model, it is important to\nremember that the original saved sketch from Gravity Sketch [ extension .GRS ]\ncan be directly opened into the Rhino environment. All gestural STROKE and INK\ntools are saved with both the external geometry and an internal NURBS line. All\nsurfaces are saved as NURBS surfaces. Layers and material choices made in\nGravity Sketch are maintained in the Rhino environment. All surfaces are clean\nand can be modified as Breps directly in Grasshopper. If the conceptual sketch\nwas refined into planes and surfaces with non-manifold edges, the original\nsketch can be directly modified with Grasshopper definitions. The original\nline-work can thereby be preserved and serve as controlling curve for all other\ndesign development when imported into Rhino. The virtual reality aspect of the Sketchfab Mobile App previewer The Gravity Sketch model can also be exported to Sketchfab, which is\ndesktop and mobile platform for viewing 3D models on the internet. The ability\nto view the model outside a VR environment is essential to team communication\nand team collaboration. The Sketchfab mobile application also allows us to use\naugmented reality to place the model into the context of the physical\nenvironment, using a phone or tablet as a viewport into the digital world.  Additionally, the model can be visualized in\nvirtual reality through the Sketchfab mobile app using a Google Cardboard\nviewer. The Augmented Reality model previewer incorporated into the Sketchfab mobile application The desktop interface, editor and previewer of Sketchfab on a computer or desktop. Apart from Gravity Sketch, there is another virtual reality\nsoftware that can be used to create specific, metrically influenced\nmodifications of the design. This would be directly launched from Rhino\nenvironment as a plugin. The virtual reality environment will only show\nGrasshopper geometries that have been associated with the Mindesk component. In\nthis version of Mindesk, there is no way to access the Grasshopper definition\nfrom VR. The only way to manipulate the definition is by basing the geometries\non “real” geometries visible in Rhino such as curves or points. The NURB points\nof these curves can be modified in Mindesk VR to change the Grasshopper shape. Preparing the Grasshopper definition for Mindesk The Mindesk plugin is an easy install and serves as another type\nof view in Rhino. The designer can work in VR which produces a direct\nconnection to Rhino and vice versa. The virtual reality window can be launched\ndirectly through the Rhino environment and become a window for viewing the\nmodel, much like the Left, Right or Perspective vires. It is important to note\nthat when in the virtual reality viewer, Mindesk VR does not allow you to\nswitch between layers or make material modifications. When scaling, Mindesk always provides a ratio of scale in the\ndistance between the two controllers so that the designer is aware if the model\nis drawn exactly as intended proportionally. Additionally, when drawing\npolylines, the lengths are measured in real time with ortho snapping options.\nMindesk can be used to directly edit any feature of the Rhino-imported concept\nmodel in addition to any other forms originated from Rhino purely. The array of\ntools is based on all the basic Rhino commands including extrude, offset, and\nloft. Unlike Gravity Sketch, however, modifications of surface modeling with\ncontrol points is not available with this version of Mindesk. Modeling and adjusting in Mindesk The Result: The use of VR for sketching and modeling architecture can help\npreserve the purity of the original gestural sketches throughout the design\nevolution. The original sketch can be quantified metrically, preserved\ndigitally, and serve as the controlling curve/form for further development in\nRhino, Grasshopper and Revit. Throughout this process of testing the capacities of sketching in\nvirtual reality in both Gravity Sketch and Mindesk, I had spent over 140 hours\n(and counting) in an immersive environment. It is not that it was necessary to\nspend this much time to learn the system — in fact, the opposite was true. The\nfirst day, I immediately had a feel for the ease of use and was drawn to the\nability to suspend my thoughts in midair, with the ability to work at a variety\nof scales, easily inhabiting the line-work I had intuitively drawn. Over the\ncourse of a few months, I found myself turning to sketching in VR more\nfrequently, even if for a brief 30-minute session. The simple fact that every\nillustration I produced was already digitally transferred and malleable saved\nme hours of time and revolutionized my personal design process. Figure above is a diagram to\nchart the decision-making processes to decide upon which VR sketch is best for\nthe design intentions. There are, of course, many methods of VR sketching- some of which\nare more effective than others for producing metric architectural drawings. The\nflow chart above outlines some basic questions to deciding which VR sketching\ntool to use – Mindesk or Gravity Sketch. Since the Gravity Sketch interface is\nvery user-friendly, with layer systems involved, it serves as a more effective\ntool for concept design. As of today’s, version of Mindesk, we may only model\nin one layer, with a materiality that is preset to that layer within Rhino.\nThis information is modifiable in Rhino but requires the user to take the\nheadset off, thereby disrupting the VR experience. On the other hand, Mindesk\noffers real-time metric feedback and works well with Grasshopper. Therefore, I\nconclude that Mindesk software is best served in a model-refinement design\nprocess while Gravity Sketch is best used for conceptual sketching. Both\napplications would benefit from some research and development for more tailored\ntools for architecture. For now, a few strategies are necessary to augment the\nsoftware to facilitate the most effective conceptual design development. This\nmay include bringing in prepared grid-lines, and site models before entering\nthe VR environment.

    "content": "Project increases value through computation Design Investigation Utilizing adaptive families to create a parametric gradated façade with optimized panelization, and efficient documentation for construction and manufacturing The design intent for CHoP – PAOB façade was to have a gradated curtain-wall that starts out as a sawtooth pattern in plan and elevation and eventually flattens out into a typical curtain-wall system. The sawtooth facade design is intended to control sun glare on the south façade – which faces the Schuylkill River – without the use of attached sun control devices that would be fixed elements to the façade.  Rather, the intent of the design was to have a façade that feels as if it is moving and breathing in response to the site conditions. The design was originally studied in hand sketches, 3D Max to review massing, shade, shadow and overall design within the site context.  Revit was brought in later in the SD process to procure initial SD documentation drawings to initiate the drawing set. The initial SD model in Revit utilized the wall tool with punched opening windows to study the design.  Upon transition to DD, the best methods of rapid design iterations and documentation were discussed and evaluated. The project and Digital Practice team had a quick brainstorming session, and after a bit of hands – on experimentation decided to utilize intelligent space-aware adaptive components for the panels in lieu of a typical curtain-wall panel. This decision was driven by the need to quickly iterate through various “behaviors” of the panels: peaks and valleys, variable height of the fascia point,  offset from the corner to create checkerboard effect, etc.  Property line restrictions per code requirements as well as other constraints required the need for flexibility in overall form – driving parameters as well as allow for adaptations of design for constructability. Additionally, we needed to be able to easily document all lengths, angles and have accurate line of connection of the panels to the floor plates/ slab edge. The solution was an adaptive curtain panel repeated and hosted into a mass family.  This solution allows placing the South and West mass family once per floor (copy to even and add floors respectively) and quickly iterate through various designs, counts, length and placements of nested repeating adaptive components without the need to re-insert them.  Each panel has a automatically calculated SequentialNumber parameter which in turn allows each panel to compute its geometry.  This approach also enables documenting all dimension in schedules (utilizing reporting parameters), without a need to painstakingly dimension each different panel when something changes. Three Optimization challenges Initial design determined corner conditions at the start of each even and odd level and how close from another corner we want the panels to be flat. Once the system was built, we easily iterated through different panel widths and other parameters studying design, while making sure that zigzagging property line was respected.  We also developed a variation of the panel with louver for mechanical floor. Upon meeting with the Client, Construction Manager and Client’s selected Curtain-wall fabricator, the issue of cost, fabrication, oversize glazing panels, logistics of delivery of panels to the site as well as rationalizing the curtain-wall came up as a critical items for review.  As a result, the client asked PW to rationalize the module so that the design intent of a gradated design would remain intact but the glazing panels would not exceed 9’-9 3/4” in width for purposes of cost, constructability and not creating a glazing panel that fell into the category of oversize glazing.  The adaptive component was then modified to meet these requirements. Rules applied to the parameters changed so the width of the glazed panel remained constant, peaks and valleys stayed the same, and only position of the moving horizontal point was recalculated.  We did not have to manually replace everything – changed a couple of formulas, and loaded the new panels into the walls in one fell swoop. As a result, all the glass panels in a sawtooth part remained identical resulting in significant cost reduction. Third challenge came from the Curtain-wall fabricator. They asked us to rethink the logic in such a way that they can create manufacturing rig of the same size for all panels. To do that, we needed to base our design on the distance between valleys, not peaks. Adaptive components logic was easily changed to accommodate this requirement. No need to manually replace or re-dimension Under the Hood For each façade, the adaptive curtain panel was hosted on a mass family, with one of the vertical surfaces divided to host an adaptive panel (placed using repeater). Since the alternate levels were designed to produce checkerboard effect and we needed flexibility for corner offset, the host mass insertion point was always at the corner grids intersection, and the mass offset was parametric (one type for even levels, another for odd).Considerations and parameters for the longer South river facing façade were different than the West facing shorter façade but the principle was the same The length of the host mass is a calculated parameter based on desired number of panels and panel width. . Additionally,  this mass family has parameters for controlling nested adaptive panels: BeakMax and BeakMin, FloorHeight, VariableHeightIncrement, etc. Parameters that are used for host family are highlighted in yellow, and parameters which are passed to adaptive families are highlighted in green. Adaptive family changes its geometry based on its placement. This is achieved by using three adaptive points and calculating the sequential number of the panel using reporting parameters DistanceFromStart and PanelWidth parameter. tying it all together Utilizing a 3-point placement system 2 points for the placement of the family (hosted on divided surface) and the 3 rd point always tying into the start point of the first panel.Tying back to the start point allowed for a reporting dimension to be taken from the start point so each panel sequential number and geometry could be calculated based on its location on the host Two adaptive components are inserted into mass family using placement points. Pass parameters from the mass to adaptive families, then create repeater Mass family inserted on one even and one odd floor, adjusted corner offsets  – copy to other levels This method allowed for automatically gradually adjusting geometry of the panels until zero point/ flattening was achieved. Driving design iterations This is a very fast paced project, and  we needed a method of driving rapid design iterations. This can be done from the schedules Automatic documentation With all those changes, we needed a reliable and easy way to document and check our work for discrepancies. Adaptive components can actually report their own dimensions using reporting parameters,  so instead of painstakingly re- dimensioning every time we adjust our design, we used much more efficient method: documenting with schedules PRACTICE AREA Healthcare OFFICE New York PROJECT CHoP PAOB EXTERIOR DESIGN TEAM Rob Goodwin; Sean Erickson; Emma Peng; Eric Baker; Dahmahlee Lawrence COMPUTATIONAL TEAM Helen Gorina, Dahmahlee Lawrence TOOLS 3D Max for SD; Revit (with Adaptive Components and Repeaters) for DD and CD.",

We are thrilled to offer this new class of laptop to those delivering exceptional design solutions to our clients. It weighs no more than a MacBook Pro! Close to 1,000 laptops have been deployed already and we expect to be 100% complete within 24 months. And maybe even most importantly , this new class of laptop coupled with Autodesk BIM360 Design will allow your team to work on Revit models directly on their laptop in and out of the office. This provides many advantages including: centralizing data in the cloud [allowing for new automated workflows], simplifying mobility, and simplifying the firm’s technology. For those who have received a new laptop, the below MINI GUIDE has been created to help you with what you can expect and give you some helpful hints to get the most out of your laptop and keep apps up to date. Here are a few things to consider: Our standard Design and Delivery laptop, the MSI Stealth, is powerful enough for the majority of our Revit workflows.  Meaning working locally, or edge computing, is now possible. This guide is to help understand how you can effectively work in and outside of the office depending on if your Revit model is or is not hosted on the cloud using Autodesk BIM360 Design. Following these guidelines will help to reduce corruption and improve performance for you and the rest of your team. Connecting To Your Revit Model Is your team utilizing Autodesk BIM360Design? YES , open your Project’s Revit model from your laptop anywhere, any time Not sure , talk to your local Digital Practice team member to see if your project is a good fit for the cloud. NO, here’s what to do: When your team’s Revit model is saved to your local P drive and you are physically in the studio, open the model on your laptop . When you are in your studio but working on a project in another studio or project cloud, use the comp node for that location. Here’s How When you are working outside of a Perkins&Will office, like a coffee shop, airport, or  grandma’s house.  Use the comp node of the studio hosting the model. Here’s How Selecting the correct node will reduce model corruption and sync times. But don’t worry if you accidentally select the wrong one, we will remind you with an annoying pop up Alert . Keeping Apps Up to Date As we work more and more directly on our high performance laptops it will become more important to regularly keep our applications up to date. This will be the new norm , just as we have become accustomed to updating our phones. Every effort is made by the Application Deployment team to make these updates as unobtrusive as possible [and will continue to do so] but it is very important to read the popups as they require varying actions such as closing other applications before proceeding. Update deadlines vary between 1-3 weeks based on the urgency. Please do not wait until the deadline , it is embarrassing to have our clients wait through updates on your laptop. Both popups show a deadline. You have until the stated deadline [red box], to install the app or update. If you defer, please note that the install will automatically begin on the deadline date [see yellow highlight]. The popup can have up to 3 options depending on the circumstances. Close Programs If you have applications open that interfere with the install, this will force close those apps without saving . It is recommended to save and close these apps before proceeding. Defer If this isn’t a good time [close to a meeting or deadline] or you are outside of the office , click defer. But remember this can only be done up until the stated deadline. Continue You are ready to install the software or update right now. Finally, you get one more warning before the install starts This last warning is to let you know there is always a chance for a restart without warning [yellow highlight]. If you are running the install before its deadline has passed you will get one last option to bail out on the install. If the deadline has passed, the only option is to continue. Please save all your work before clicking Yes or Continue . Some Tips for your new High Performance Laptop We know you work hard and will push these machines to deliver solutions that knock our client’s socks off. Here are a few things to consider to get the most out of your laptop, especially when you need it most. If you are creating high resolution renderings, video or other intensive tasks: Keep the computer open and on a flat surface to prevent it from possibly overheating. Keep it plugged in. Switching to battery will change the mode of the graphics card, also all that graphic power hammers the battery. Try to make it a habit to shutdown before placing the laptop in a bag or backpack Besides avoiding possible overheating, you will be clearing the cache and memory. Function (Fn) + F6 turns the webcam on/off during skype calls. Use Function (Fn) + PGUP/PGDN to adjust the brightness of your keyboard Restart regularly 🙂",

    "content": "Collaboration is at the heart of everything we do, and we are thrilled to begin offering new applications & services to increase collaboration inside and outside the firm’s walls in the continuing journey to Platform 3.0 .  In the past month we have all migrated from Box.com to OneDrive and Microsoft Teams is being introduced for project collaboration. We’re anticipating that more projects will be required to utilize Autodesk BIM360 in the future.  As a result, an investment in new high performance laptops has been made. This coupling of hardware and Autodesk cloud services will keep Perkins&Will ahead of the curve and in a position to continue to deliver outstanding solutions to our clients. In an effort to tighten integration with Microsoft’s collaboration and cloud platforms, the decision was made to adopt Microsoft OneDrive and Teams for all cloud storage. While this will not replace Nasuni for our primary Revit based storage, it did eliminate the need for Box.com. MS Teams will not only increase our own internal collaboration, but also change the way we work with clients and partners throughout the design process. Over time, Teams will replace Skype for Business and act as an all-encompassing collaboration platform (sometime in 2020). A list of microKnowledge cards have been created so you can get up and running in your MS Team and OneDrive. A streamlined training session is currently in the works, check with your local Digital Practice team member to learn more. Autodesk BIM360 is set to improve connectivity between project teams, their clients, contractors and consultants. This new addition to our platform will reduce collaboration barriers while providing a central project location in the cloud. This, in turn, will reduce rework while accelerating project delivery. When BIM360 is paired with the firm’s new high performance laptops , a new level of mobility will be achieved. Applications that were once unavailable will become more readily available and new automated workflows will also be introduced. As these new laptops continue to roll out across the firm, you can expect a significant push to begin utilizing BIM360. Please reach out to your local Digital Practice team member to find out if BIM 360 is right for your project team. Please be on the lookout for more information on these announcements in the coming weeks/months. Should you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please reach out to your local GTS and/or Digital Practice team member .",

    "content": "This Months Horror story Happened in the Galaxy far far away and is about such an innocent operation in Revit as working with Dimensions. Who would think that Dimensions could be dangerous, and maybe even deadly… Here is the story as related by Jordan Musset. In the very beginning of the project SD phase someone  on the team created a new dimensions style  with name *PW Linear 3/32 SD* . It was similar  in appearance to our standard style *PW Linear 3/32 with one critical difference: This dimension style was set to round to the nearest 6″ ! The intention was to use this style tor Schematic Design – hence “SD” Later someone else on the team assumed it was a special dimension style for Stair Details, “SD”. As seen on the image on the left, this dimension style have rounded up to 6″  when the real dimension value was just above 3″. It gets scarier: This team  entered CA essentially right in the middle of extra coordination with the structural engineering team because many items came up all of a sudden that needed to be rectified as a result of fixing this Dimension Style problem. The problem was discovered on detail sheets, but this dimension style was used on a multitude of other drawings as well. There were over 300 instances of this dimension placed and there was no quick way of knowing if these dimensions were incorrect and going to cause a problem. This is a very preventable problem. There are 6 Dimension style in the firm wide template and in your office project templates.   Those styles should serve most purposes on your project.  However, there could be much more (an average of 39)  Dimension Styles  in our projects. Unnecessary dimension style with cryptic names are confusing to the team and can become a HUGE problem and liability as illustrated in this horror story.",

Most notably a\nlong span roof with a high arched roof structure and expansive glass walls\n(including 5-layer, 2” thick blast glass) around the perimeter of the\nConcourse. The roof trusses spanned the 105-foot Concourse width and\ncantilevered 17 feet past the supporting columns. As part of the building\ndesign the south elevation of the glass sloped out creating additional forces\nto columns and floor slab. Stress Test Diagram Due to the design, a steel connection was designed to transfer the loads at the columns and floor slab. However, due to the geometry and significant loading occurring at the floor, the connection became large, bulky, and aesthetically unpleasant. As a result, the Design Team began to explore the advantages of the structural casting process; the benefits of this process included the integration of the dual column for structural support and bracing into a singular base, fire-resistance rating, and the use of high-performance coating. The challenges inherent with structural components were mostly comprised by the forces acting at the floor level and needing to meet fire protection requirements. The column base, per IBC, needed to have a 2-hour fire resistance; Due to their prominent placement in the Concourse they also warranted a high-performance coating (versus an intumescent paint). Given the structural and architectural parameters the team developed a series of conceptual ideas using Augmented Reality (AR) and 3-D modeling in 1-to-1 scale and superimposing the model in the real world. This process allowed all members of the team to view and conceptualize the base in real time. 3D Printed Model Due to the location and prominence of the column nodes it was important to have an extensive design effort to make these column nodes both sculptural and expressive. Perkins&Will and Cast Connex worked together through an iterative process, providing design comments and receiving digital models. Using Augmented Reality to push the design was crucial to achieving the final product. As a tool, AR was especially beneficial to the column node because of its human scale (As opposed to working with an entire building). Team members were able to build and portray 3D concept study models and see them as a 1-to-1 scale. Augmented Reality was especially helpful when trying to help visualize the column node to the design team, client, and consultants. The bases required a public bid and were outlined in 05 Specification. The specification delegated structural design responsibility to the casting supplier, outlined responsibilities, and outlined structural performance and aesthetic requirements for the castings. This method allowed the Design and Construction team to procure the desired structural design. The Column base detail is a custom designed cast steel column base node that can be seen throughout the CLT Concourse A Expansion Phase I. The column base design was a collaborative effort between the Perkins&Will, casting design-builder (Cast-Connex), and Stewart Engineering. The result of this process produced a sculptural 4,000-pound, 3’x4’x4’ Column Node with expressive counter bores that creates both an architectural and structural expression in the new concourse, all while working with available new technologies.

    "content": "A complete IFC Guide for sharing and exchanging BIM\ndata in Denmark SHL co-authored a complete IFC Guide for the Danish market. Building Information Modelling (BIM) has become the new standard in the architectural process by delivering construction and design coordination improvements, quality assurances, and cost savings. The demand for sharing and exchanging data has increased in recent years at our firm and throughout the industry. The term OpenBIM is being used more and more. OpenBIM is a universal approach to the collaborative design, realization, and operation of buildings based on open standards and workflows. For shared Building Models, ex. a Revit Model, the IFC format is the OpenBIM building model format. Therefore, if one consultant is using Revit and another consultant is using Tekla, the IFC format will be used for sharing geometry and data. Okay, so we just need to export and IFC file of our Revit or Rhino model and all is good? Unfortunately to create good useable files for any recipient is not easy – and that is therefore why the IFC Guide has been created. The trick is to get the data and geometry to be structured correctly.   Example a Revit Wall needs to be an IfcWall, and sometimes it is more complicated: We have modeled a Ceiling Shirt with the Revit´s Wall tool. If we just export the model, the Ceiling Skirt will be an IfcWall, which is not correct – the IfcCovering.Ceiling is. Ohh my, Why is this important? First, to do OpenBIM and collaborated between vendor´s software we need a format to communicate, and of course, we need to have valid data. We want to have a wall create in ArchiCAD to be wall, when imported to Revit. Second, all Clients in Europe want this. They don’t want to be locked to the consultant´s chosen software. The facility manager must be able to run their building for many years without struggling to access their own data. Third, with the IFC format, we can use Solibri. Solibri can do collisions controls like Navisworks but also a lot more advanced checks such as EXAMPLES. In IFC part 2, we will go further in detail with the opportunities with Solibri. Beside\ndescribe how IFC is exported from Revit, The IFC guide also cover how to do good\nIFC exports form ArchiCAD. More BIM-software are to be added soon as well as chapters\nabout IFC-imports from different software’s. The\nDanish IFC-guide can be found here: https://www.molio.dk/faa-hjaelp-til-ifc-med-opdateret-guide Unfortunately\nonly a Danish version of guide is available right now but a English version is\ncoming soon, you can read a IFC Guide by Autodesk,\nwhich is covering some of the same topics. Also Our microKnowledge site is already has cards showing how manage the IFC-export: How do I export an IFC file from Revit? How do I override the default export for IFC Class and IFC Type for an object type? Any questions, don’t hesitate to contact Simon saa@shl.dk or Nicklas nvo@shl.dk .",

    "content": "Over the years, the supposedly hyperreal option for design visualization, the “Make Me a Beautiful Render” button has been elusive. It was the case for all of the late ’80s, ’90s, and the 2000’s up to 2013. Once Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) matured enough to challenge conventional rendering processes, the game has shifted entirely towards quicker, more effective, experiential, and now images that convey and evoke terms such as ambiance without too much effort. Instead of the “Render My Project Button,” in 2019, we received the “Make It Easy” Button when it comes to rendering in the future –  soon to be 2020. So how does it compare to Lumion Pro 9? For one, Epic Games has released Twinmotion 2019 for free\nuntil November 2019 which is about 2,999 Euros less than Lumion Pro 9. Twinmotion works on both the PC and MAC, while Lumion does not. Twinmotion has a VR mode for real-time scene work and effects transition while Lumion does not.  It works with just about every VR controllers such as the VIVE, Oculus Rift, Windows Mixed Reality, and Samsung Gear VR.  We all have wondered what it might be like to design with a real-time rendering tool.  Now we need to figure out how to make it a collaborative environment, and then there might be some interesting to take place next. Image from letsdesignstudios.com It supports a ton of import formats similarly to Lumion.  When you export your Revit model, it makes an FBX version that it uses for the rendering environment, and it allows for the possibility to synchronize the scene with Revit. Twinmotion supports a hierarchical scene management system, while Lumion uses a layer model.  Hierarchical scene management is similar to working in 3DSMax. Twinmotion has support for full environmental control such as material mapping, physically-based rendering, and the sound material module can alter the overall scene acoustics.  For those that prefer to mix their environment to perfection, it allows for control of the Sun, Weather, and Season just like in Lumion. Twinmotion allows for the export of a VR-capable self-running file of your scene for your client to experience. Twinmotion supports a complete content asset system through BIMobject library connection, including the capability to adjust the size, rotation, height, color, and other features such as mass and cluster placement of objects with random mixing. Image from letsdesignstudios.com Twinmotion supports path driven animation for characters, animals, water bodies, water fountains, particles, and object animation along user-created paths for diagrams or custom articulation like a car traveling over a speed bump with all the correct physics translation. Image from letsdesignstudios.com What about lights, phasing\nand time-lapse and other rendering features? Twinmotion supports a clay model mode that can selectively affect certain objects or the entire scene.  It also has perspective, axonometric, and orthographic views. Twinmotion has all of the common types of IES lights and effects, including shadow quality. The in-camera features support perspective correction, depth of field, lens flare, motion blur, bloom, and ambient occlusion, which the latter not found in Lumion. If you have ever used the isolate selection in Revit or other tools, then you will also find them in Twinmotion for isolating objects to focus on the material, lighting, and composition for your scene. Interestingly, you can use a section plane cut in your visualizations along with a phasing feature to review portions of the project in a particular sequence to tell your project story with a subtle element of time-lapse. Twinmotion also supports batch render for image, panorama, video, and the standalone file option for your client to view. Did I mention it was free? If you want to give Twinmotion a try for visualization of your project, then ask your Design Applications for how you can have it on your MSI laptop. Spreadsheet comparing Twinmotion and Lumion",

The conference admission was only $100. A few of the highlights from attendees follow. Access to Unreal Academy Recordings Epic Games recorded all the classes and labs from Unreal Academy and made them available online. Go to https://academy.unrealengine.com/ to access them. If you do not already have an Unreal account create one. If an online lab does not provide access to the class files we have them on the Perkins&Will network. Once we find a permanent home for the files, we will revise this article to include a link. Classes and Labs A high percentage of labs were offered compared to other conferences. The contents ranged from beginner to advanced. And it wasn’t just for people making games. Architecture and interior design were well represented at the conference including keynote speakers. Interactions Aside from learning about the workflows of bringing Revit, Rhino, SketchUp and 3ds Max geometry into Unreal Studio many of the labs and classes dealt with creating useful interactions for viewers during a virtual experience. Examples include changing the lighting, cycling through furniture arrangements and styles, design options, and setting up automatic queuing locations to highlight design features, begin an animated sequence of events or to optimize a large virtual scene by turning portions of it on and off. All of these are done in large part by using node-based programming or scripting. It was surprisingly easy to pick up with a workflow that provides immediate results. Artificial Intelligence Unreal Engine’s AI is currently limited to game AI. This less sophisticated form of AI is well suited for animating characters to interact within architectural spaces. The dynamic effect of spaces filled with activity adds a level of realism and understanding for the audience. Creating a scene with interactive characters is more advanced than other types of interactivity. Blueprints This is not a throwback to past architectural practices. Blueprints is the visual scripting system built into Unreal Engine 4. It uses the concept of a node-based interface to quickly prototype and create interactive elements from within the Unreal Editor. The system is both flexible and powerful providing the ability for designers to use the full range of concepts and tools that only programmers can typically access. Connecting Nodes, Events, Functions and Variables it is possible for those without programming skills to create complex interactive elements. It is also possible to share blueprints layouts. Soon new microKnowledge cards on Unreal authored by Simon Chavez and Emre Aslan will appear as they provide instructions with links to shareable Blueprints they have created. Connections with Unreal Employees Perkins&Will attendees met numerous Epic Games employees. These conversations led to creating support opportunities for Perkins&Will. Details are still in the works but know that should you need expert advice with an Unreal project we should be able to connect you. TwinMoition Epic Games promoted the recent purchase of Twinmotion at Unreal Academy. Previously priced at $3,200, Epic Games has made Twinmotion free to download until November. At present Twinmotion has similarities to Lumion. Comments at Unreal Academy lead us to speculate that newer versions of Twinmotion will feature Revit integration like Enscape. If true Twinmotion would provide the benefits of both Enscape and Lumion with a more advanced rendering engine.",

    "content": "The Software Games If the movies The Hunger Games & Karate Kid had a baby, the result would be The Software Games. What is it? Why do it? How were you able to pull it off? Who is Jordan Hanson? These are all great questions and I can appreciate the enthusiasm. If you are familiar with who I am (the Justin Benjamin), you know how well I can get to the point quickly… 😉 Bare with me as I attempt to tackle explaining what could possibly replace the Olympics (this is quite the exaggeration… but my heart was in the right place when I decided to make the comparison). The What. Consider “Trivia night” at your local watering hole. It’s success is likely tied to its social atmosphere (ie bonding with peers), a taste of competition (ie teamwork), a thirst for knowledge (ie training) and then a sprinkle of some type of monetary incentive (ie bribery). Now aside from the bribery (which still plays a part), the remaining reasons make for an ideal company outing… In a nutshell, that is the atmosphere we are shooting for when it comes to The Software Games. We just focus less on history/pop culture fun facts, and more on design application utilization. The Why. The Software Games is an effort developed in our New York office as an alternative form of training. Instead of rambling on about the importance of implementation as it relates to all of our innovations and application acquisitions. I will assume we can all agree that a strategy for rolling out the new tool is critical and this strategy will always incorporate training… Video tutorials are rarely watched. Documentation is rarely resourced proactively. Pushing staff into a room with me for multiple days as I run through Revit exercises… Well, that is just mean. The How. There are 4 rounds (1 task is created for each round). Rounds are 5 minutes long (the complexity of each task reflects the allotted time – contestants should have a reasonable chance in completing the task). Come game night, the audience is asked for volunteers (4 people can play per round). Those volunteers sit at one of the prepared laptops. All laptops are projected to a common screen for audience enjoyment. The MC makes them aware of the task and then calls it… Ready. Set. Go! *If staff proved reluctant to volunteer when asked, the offices DTLs were made aware of their forced participation… Just to get the ball rolling. That said, it wasn’t necessary to call upon them! The Result. Our first competition was focused around Affinity (lending to the title The Software Games: Affinity War). It was deliberately chosen because of the lack of adoption ‘Affinity Photo’ has gotten since Perkins&Will adopted the software in December 2018. Knowing that our office had many people confident in their photo editing skills, but lacked the basic knowledge of this program, made it a prime candidate for our first competition. The excitement during the competitions created a huge crowd to gather from the office to watch and support their peers. This setup allowed the competitors to learn the software, but gave the audience glimpses into the many different techniques that could be used to solve the challenges. Everyone Wins! Upon each rounds completion, the MC will review aloud the work completed by each contestant. He will ask for audience applause to help with any tough decisions. Prizes are awarded as follows: Was the task completed (minimum requirements)? Yes = $10 Amazon Who did the best job? 1 Person awarded another $10 Amazon Did you participate? No tangible prize is given, but respect from your peers for trying… That is priceless. Oh yeah, you also likely picked up a skill from having tried. SHOUT OUT TO OUR FIRST “THE SOFTWARE GAMES” WINNERS! The Future. We intend to do a couple more games internally (office specific). Once the kinks are worked out, we are going national. Washington DC… NY is coming for you next. As for the rest of the studios… Come time you are called upon… Are you going to be ready? Or are you going to be scared? The Software Games. Come Compete. Come Watch. Come Learn. Jordan Hanson? Aspiring Architect. Lead DTL. Adequate ping pong player (yet to beat me… its adorable). It was his attendance at Pixels of Fury that proved to be the foundation (architectural pun intended) for what we now refer to as The Software Games. Thank you Jordan (sorry about the ping pong player comment…)",

    "content": "RBC Gateway – Where are the Views? Design Investigation Informing Interior Layouts With View And Daylight Analysis Located along the northern edge of downtown Minneapolis, this new mid-rise tower has great potential to take advantage of the views. While the tower design is being completed by another architect, Perkins+Will is leading the workplace strategy and interiors for a client located on levels 11-21 of the building. As with many tower projects, two of the big design drivers related to the architecture are access to daylight and views. We quickly indicated potential views around the tower, but wanted to be more strategic in locating how those views could inform the planning. Which spaces might want a river view? Where on the floorplate is downtown visible? Are there any zones on the floorplate that don’t have much of a view at all? To run this study, we used a 3D model of Minneapolis and drew bounding regions around the four main potential views: The Mississippi River, The Warehouse District, Target Field, and Downtown. By populating these regions with a 3D grid of points, we were then able to do a quick vector analysis to see where on each floorplate each view was visible. By running the study for each floor, our team was able to use this data to inform the planning. In addition to the view study, we wanted to use daylight to help inform our planning strategies as well. By superimposing all of the views for each floorplate and placing them side by side with a daylight study for each floor, we had a clear understanding of how these two factors could inform the planning for each floorplate.

    "content": "Suzhou Science + Technology Museum – Weaving a Complex Facade Design Investigation Exploring the Weaving Pattern The Suzhou Science + Technology Museum project began as a design competition entry that emphasized the region’s historical use of silk for textiles through a fluid form with a “woven” facade pattern. Upon winning the competition, the challenge began with how to technically achieve this woven facade pattern in a rational manner. One of the first challenges was finding a way to simplify the doubly curved surface into fairly regular panel sizes to reduce the amount of unique panels required for fabrication. Grasshopper was used as the tool to both rationalize this surface and quickly test different facade patterns that could invoke the “weaving” notion. Above – Each color represents a unique panel size After these initial studies, it became clear the client desired the facade to look closer to the competition entry of weaving panels. We took a step back and re-evaluated how we might be able to break down the facade in a rational way that could also achieve this look. This led us to investigating how we could take a simple grid and create a tessellated pattern within that grid. In the end, we were able to achieve a weaving facade pattern with around 10 unique panels. With this logic established, the final test for us was to have a mock-up created to ensure that this design could be achievable.

These functions are distributed as a Grasshopper plugin and when installed they appear as buttons in their own tab, just like any other plugin. Just recently four new snippets were added to the mix, including; Create a staircase with landing, this script follows a polyline which when inclined is a run and flat produces a landing. Library bookshelf generator, a parametric generator that gives you an accurate layout and info on how many books you can fit. Environment data sheet, this button creates a printable sheet for your site that includes outdoor comfort, wind, radiation, and sun path information. Multi-layer Make2D, this script automatically makes 2D diagrams of several layers. In addition to these new snippets, we also have updates on four others including; Create baluster railing, this one added data on the railing and fixed some bugs. Create glass railing, this one also added data on the railing and fixed bugs. Area calculation tool, this one was updated to work with semantic and added merged overlapping volumes and different units. Multi-layer area tool, the updates include different units, ignores empty layers, displays surfaces being calculated as white. You will see a little black bar in the bottom right corner of the snippet buttons that are new or updated. Below are some how-to videos on using some of these tools that are available.

    "content": "Scott Schroeder, Director of Visualization of our Denver\noffice, will share some best practice in creating high quality photorealistic\nrenderings using 3ds Max and Unreal Engine. Starting with the creation of\nparametric models in 3ds Max then transporting the models into Unreal Engine\nfor high quality rendering and animation. He will dive into the following\nprocess: Using RailClone to generate parametric\nseating bowl. Creating animated people using Forest Pro . Transferring models from 3ds Max into Unreal Engine using various\nplugins such as Datasmith , Optim , Substance ,\nand GPU Lightmass baker. Testing with raytracing inside Unreal using RTX\ncards. Getting animated people into Unreal using shared\nrig and animations. Using Substance\nDesigner to create a master material library for all rendering software. Comparing Substance Designer workflow versus\nother universal material formats such as NVIDIA’s\nMDL and ILM’s Material X . Class Notes by Scott Schroeder Importing models into Unreal with Datasmith Datasmith is a plugin being developed by Epic, who are the creators of the Unreal Engine. This plugin is aimed at making the trip from CAD software to Unreal almost seamless. However, there are a few exceptions that this plugin does not do. This plugin does not organize the file for you. A messy CAD file will be messy in Unreal. Before going into any real time engine, taking a few extra steps to make sure the scene is organized, optimized, and generally contains only the objects needed to display in real time. More information about Datasmith and the use cases for software such as Max, Rhino, Revit, and SketchUp in this section of the documentation. https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Studio/Datasmith/SoftwareInteropGuides/index.html Automated Datasmith Optimization with Optim Optim is a tool that runs inside the Unreal Engine that scans a Datasmith file and gives an overview of what is included in that file. The primary function of this plugin is to take scene optimization that had to be done manually in Unreal or the software used to create the geometry and automate the process. What used to take 20+ hours in Unreal, can now be done in just a few hours if not under an hour. Once inside the Optim Dashboard, there are specific areas that will give more detailed information about the geometry, lights, and materials in the Datasmith file. A user can create rules to tell Optim to merge similar geometry, or generate LODs(Level of Detail) for any piece of geometry over a certain number of polygons. Users can save and load rules to help further speed up the process inside the dashboard. Optim is currently in open\nBeta, meaning that while the software works there are bound to be a few bugs\nwith it. One major hurdle for Optim is that Unreal needs to have full admin\nprivileges to be able to launch the dashboard. It is suspected that because\nUnreal needs to launch Optim as an external program, any user without admin\nprivileges will have that process blocked as it appears suspicious. To view\nmore about Optim and sign up for the Beta program, please visit https://theia.io/optim/ Ray Tracing in Unreal with NVIDIA RTX graphics cards Starting with Unreal Engine version 4.22, raytracing is now available to use for those who have an NVIDIA RTX graphics card. Ray tracing in Unreal can produce real-time transparency, soft shadows, reflections, global illumination, and ambient occlusion. In previously versions of Unreal, many of the previously listed items had to be prebuilt (or baked) into the scene at a cost of rather long bake times. The image below is a screenshot from Unreal that has real time reflections and global illumination enabled. The time to bake these elements into the scene file was 0 minutes. The same scene as above but with baked global illumination and reflections. The time to bake these elements into the scene was about 45 minutes using production quality settings. While raytracing in real time\nis indeed very cool new technology, there are a few important items to keep in\nmind when considering using it on any project. Ray tracing is a computationally intensive\nprocess on the graphics card (GPU). Ray traced global illumination is the most\nintensive process on the GPU and is better left to use on exterior only\nprojects. Projects that have interiors should consider using the baked global\nillumination method. The scene in Unreal needs to be as optimized as\npossible. Enabling ray tracing will cause a loss of the number of frames per\nsecond (FPS) being displayed. If the FPS drops below 30, the experience will\nbecome laggy and unenjoyable. Therefore, the scene needs to be optimized enough\nthat the loss in FPS due to raytracing is manageable. Ray tracing in Unreal is not an import model,\nfire, and forget process. There needs to be time devoted to setting the scene\nup properly. For client presentations, the laptops must be\nplugged in. Running on battery power is not recommended at all for this process. There recently was a webinar\nfrom Epic and Buildmedia about using ray tracing and RTX cards for\narchitectural visualization. The replay is available at this link, https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/ray-tracing-for-architectural-visualization-webinar-replay Universal Material Workflow with the Substance Suite of Tools Substance is a set of material creation tools developed by Allegorithmic and was recently acquired by Adobe. Using Substance, it will be possible to create a master material library that anyone, regardless of software, would be able to use. Here in the Denver studio, we’ve been just scratching at the surface as to how best to implement this new technology. Be on the lookout for some exciting news in the very near future. The image below shows a general overview of creating carpet patterns in Substance Designer.",

    "content": "A complete IFC Guide for sharing and exchanging BIM\ndata in Denmark SHL co-authored a complete IFC Guide for the Danish market. Building Information Modelling (BIM) has become the new standard in the architectural process by delivering construction and design coordination improvements, quality assurances, and cost savings. The demand for sharing and exchanging data has increased in recent years at our firm and throughout the industry. The term OpenBIM is being used more and more. OpenBIM is a universal approach to the collaborative design, realization, and operation of buildings based on open standards and workflows. For shared Building Models, ex. a Revit Model, the IFC format is the OpenBIM building model format. Therefore, if one consultant is using Revit and another consultant is using Tekla, the IFC format will be used for sharing geometry and data. Okay, so we just need to export and IFC file of our Revit or Rhino model and all is good? Unfortunately to create good useable files for any recipient is not easy – and that is therefore why the IFC Guide has been created. The trick is to get the data and geometry to be structured correctly.   Example a Revit Wall needs to be an IfcWall, and sometimes it is more complicated: We have modeled a Ceiling Shirt with the Revit´s Wall tool. If we just export the model, the Ceiling Skirt will be an IfcWall, which is not correct – the IfcCovering.Ceiling is. Ohh my, Why is this important? First, to do OpenBIM and collaborated between vendor´s software we need a format to communicate, and of course, we need to have valid data. We want to have a wall create in ArchiCAD to be wall, when imported to Revit. Second, all Clients in Europe want this. They don’t want to be locked to the consultant´s chosen software. The facility manager must be able to run their building for many years without struggling to access their own data. Third, with the IFC format, we can use Solibri. Solibri can do collisions controls like Navisworks but also a lot more advanced checks such as EXAMPLES. In IFC part 2, we will go further in detail with the opportunities with Solibri. Beside\ndescribe how IFC is exported from Revit, The IFC guide also cover how to do good\nIFC exports form ArchiCAD. More BIM-software are to be added soon as well as chapters\nabout IFC-imports from different software’s. The\nDanish IFC-guide can be found here: https://www.molio.dk/faa-hjaelp-til-ifc-med-opdateret-guide Unfortunately\nonly a Danish version of guide is available right now but a English version is\ncoming soon, you can read a IFC Guide by Autodesk,\nwhich is covering some of the same topics. Also Our microKnowledge site is already has cards showing how manage the IFC-export: How do I export an IFC file from Revit? How do I override the default export for IFC Class and IFC Type for an object type? Any questions, don’t hesitate to contact Simon saa@shl.dk or Nicklas nvo@shl.dk .",

Our drone experts introduced the UAV user group, its members and missions, then presented how they have integrated the use of drones into their design workflow. Randy Maxwell (Atlanta), Chen Qin (Boston) and Ryan Rideout (Seattle) each presented their projects that used drone and shared valuable lessons learned from their experience. The UAV user group introduced their pulse page, “ UAV Community “, which contains videos of their flights and other very useful information from charts, pre-flight planning, and insurance documentation and reference materials. The UAV Community at Perkins&Will had worked closely with our legal department to obtain firmwide insurance coverage for our drone squad, so that future drone projects will have a smoother process when dealing with insurance and liability issues.",

    "content": "The newest version of V-Ray, named NEXT has a number of notable improvements and new features for those working in Rhino and SketchUp. Not all the advertised features are worth mentioning, so Digital Practice has filtered out the hype to give you a concise reading of what you are most likely to find relevant to your design visualization needs. Testing for NEXT at Perkins&Will took place in May. NEXT tested successfully with other Perkins&Will software, nodes and laptops. Expect to see NEXT appear in early June as it is pushed to nodes and laptops or available for install via Software Center. FASTER RENDER TIMES It’s true. However the results can vary significantly from scene to scene. BOOST x2 for INTERIOR RENDERINGS The new Adaptive Dome Light will easily be considered the best new feature for those creating interior renderings. It eliminates the previous workflow of placing, sizing and tweaking multiple Light Portals at the various windows and openings which bringing light into an interior space. In its place… Just the new Adaptive Dome Light to the scene as seen in the image below. How’s that for simple. Furthering its value is reduced render times. Chaos Group claims up to seven times faster. Digital Practice’s test render times were reduced by half, but that is still impressive. These are really useful improvements that should feel noticeably beneficial to anyone creating interior renderings. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ?! Chaos Group is using the term Scene Intellig ence when referring to the automation of both Exposure and White Balance . They claim artificial intelligence is used to “learn” your scene and automatically apply the perfect settings for both exposure and white balance. Even if it fall just short of perfect, unless you are very good at adjusting these two settings in tandem this new features will be a time saver. While it can be applied to all renderings it will be most beneficial to those creating interior renderings and animations. ASSET EDITOR IMPROVEMENTS are SIGNIFICANT, but RELATIVE No doubt there are many improvements to the V-Ray Asset Editor, but how much time you typically spend there will influence your opinion about the value it brings you. The many improvements to asset management can be summed up as comprehensive and convenient. A few of the standout features are two new buttons across the top for Render Elements and Textures, an organizing outline view for all assets, the ability to add folders and custom libraries including network shareable ones, optimized search that includes sub-folders, a universal asset previewer, and the ability to select multiple assets using ctrl and shift keys to add or delete from scene. DENOISE OPTIMIZATIONS Already a favorite feature of many using V-Ray, the Denoiser is upgraded to include NVIDIA’s new AI NVIDIA algorithm. This setting is available when using the Interactive Frame Render and delivers significant speed increases. Chaos Group claims the denoise speed is “near-instant”, but this would obviously be very scene dependent. A second denoise feature targets specific elelemts by allowing individual elements to be chosen. V-Ray for GRASSHOPPER A number of features have been added to allow rendering within Grasshopper. It should be noted that not all V-Ray features within Rhino are available within Grasshopper. EXTENDED CROSS-PLATFORM SUPPORT for IMPORTS V-Ray for SketchUp adds the ability to import any .vrscene into SketchUp to expand the platforms that SketchUp can import and use. Chaos Group claims the import will maintain the size and position of geometry imported this way. NEW UTILITY TOOL BAR for SketchUp V-Ray NEXT for SketchUp gets a new tool bar with features you may find useful. The Hide V-Ray Widgets button allows the visibility of V-Ray widget to be toggled on and off. This adds convenience when creating clean screen captures of the viewport. Other descriptions are mentioned in the in the image below. BLOOM / GLARE EFFECT and METALNESS These are the two final features to be mentioned. Metalness is a new setting available within materials and shaders. It essentially adds a metal layer to materials to create realistic metal finishes. The new Bloom / Glare Effect is best explained by views the two overlapping images below. Hopefully everyone will find at least some of these new features beneficial to their visualization workflow and productivity.",

    "content": "Sharpen Your Tools: Keynote Manager in-depth Revit’s keynote system is a powerful way to integrate data into Revit families, reduce errors, and streamline documentation. The text files, though, are cumbersome and difficult to work with. Keynote Manager was created to provide a simple, efficient interface to edit keynote files. It allows to edit keynotes in a tree view, automatically sequence and easily re-organize and re-sequence keynotes, quickly search and filter. it makes it easy to for multiple people to collaborate, providing commenting and tracking capabilities. There is also an option to edit keynote file in the cloud for BIM360 projects. It makes it easy to compare keynote files to track changes. It even automatically checks the integrity of a keynote file that was edited in other applications like Excel and fix “orphaned” keynotes. Spellcheck is automatic, casing can be set as needed. Additionally, Revit Plugin Keynote Manager Plus interacts with Revit directly, and allows to apply keynotes to selected Revit elements with a single button, synchronizing key values. It clearly shows which keynotes were used in the project, and whether or not they were on the sheet. it makes is easy to find all elements that were using particular keynote for QC. Also, it can help coordinate specs and keynotes by running  and exporting keynote report. Many PW offices  are using the tool, Dallas and Austin office are  utilizing it more then others, But every office has their champions, like Rachel Gruber, Matt Sawasaki,  Diana Reyes, Amber Harris and many others. Digital practice conducted a “Train the Trainer” session, and here is the recording And here is a link to mK cards https://mk.perkinswill.com/?_sf_s=keynote&_sft_sub-application=keynote-manager New version of Keynote manager will be rolled out in the next few weeks- will support Revit 2020 and improves support for BIM360",

Perkins&Will’s Building Technology Lab & Digital Practice were able to leverage its previous research into mass timber and robotic fabrication, combining expertise across offices in a year-long effort. Robotics, mass timber, and parametric design are all key technologies that are underutilized in construction. To fully take advantage of these new technologies requires a rethinking of the entire process from design to construction. The Greenbuild Pavilion represents a new design to fabrication workflow, in which a digital parametric model is communicated directly to a robot fabricator. The robot, equipped with various tools, can manipulate dimensional lumber into complex geometries with industrial precision. This workflow has the potential to drastically improve the sustainability, quality, cost, and time of construction. Here is a recording of the presentation.",

Check out the video below for an overview of Semantic. Semantic can be used to… Assign custom data attributes to geometric objects. Define formula-driven calculations across multiple properties. Create custom queries of model data and produce exportable reports. Control model properties using a variety of UI tools. Talk to your local IT/ DA to have Semantic installed on your laptop.

In our case the moles are those pesky pop-ups everyone encounters in the Revit start up screen. For a few reasons these pests have proven difficult to get rid of, but you should have begun to see a reduction these past few weeks. If you still do encounter them, please let your local Design Application Manager know and we will work to remove them. Once the Pop Ups are removed , we will begin to use the new cleaned up start screen to collect feedback. The Digital Practice team is eager to learn where else we can streamline Revit and other design applications. We plan for these micro-polls to be no more than a handful of questions every so often. The effort to whack the moles originated from a few folks letting us know it was a huge time suck, now that we have tamed them, we want to move onto bigger fish.",

    "content": "The latest version of Enscape rolled out in April with improvements spanning a range of areas you may find beneficial. The most notable is the addition of 150 new entourage assets to Encapes’ library. This brings the total library count to 341. These new items are 3D proxies appearing monochromatic in your scene as an off-white color. A number of the items are from the third party Evermotion and are noticeably more realistic than other library assets when rendered. Example of an Evermotion Asset First under the Image tab of Settings are two new contrast sliders. The previous contrast slider has been divided into two made up of highlights and shadows. Controlling these independently should give more freedom. New Contrast Sliders If you were previously dissatisfied with how crisp or soft Ensapes’ shadows were then you will be interested in this new slider. Found within Settings under the Atmosphere tab is the Shadow Sharpness slider near the bottom. Near the top of the Atmosphere tab is a new fog slider. This slider allows you to set the height of fog in your scene giving you a bit more control over appearance. Shadow Sharpness and Fog Height Also under the Atmosphere tab the Horizon Presets see one new addition, Mountains. In addition to this new preset the White Cubes preset has visible improvements over the previous version of Enscape. New Mountain Preset For Rhino and SkecthUp the Material Editor receives improvements like a list which makes finding materials easier. The Material Editor for Rhino receives exclusive improvements allowing setting for fine tuning materials. A new Clear Coat material creates a much more realistic car paint and  improves the appearance of various metal materials such as certain  mullion finishes. Material Settings in Rhino The Video Editor has an improved Camera Path Automation tool creating a much smoother path than the previous one. There is also a new Total Duration slider to easily control the time length for camera paths. The last improvement on our list is another one for Materials. Previously Enscape may have inaccurately shown reflected textures or not shown them at all. Now when using the Ultra setting materials within reflections are visible including the details of your texture maps. This improvement also includes the ability to render reflected textures that are behind the camera’s current location.",

Aslan Figure 1: REM – Canora Model in UE4 This article will provide an overview of how one method of Unreal Engine 4’s (UE4) A.I. may be implemented in VR models for the purpose of  creating dynamic, animated actors capable of navigating a project autonomously. Canora station, of the R.E.M. LRT project (Figure 1) , was chosen as a sample environment to demonstrate A.I capabilities due to the opportunities it presents for vertical circulation – use of elevators, stairs and related interactions. Figure 2: A Target Point Asset This initial workflow will discuss the process of scripting basic  A.I. functionality in Blueprints, which will adaptively follow a sequential array of targets throughout the model, while by-passing those it cannot reach This is a very quick method of directing the A.I. Character through the space, and will use the default Third-Person Character with a Forward Walking looped animation asset. This A.I. script will allow for real-time adaptation and avoidance of geometry (such that if the model is revised, the A.I. will adapt without having to revise the script), other A.I. driven characters and the users themselves. This is accomplished by placing Target Points (Figure 2) throughout the model, defining the general path to be taken by the A.I. Character(s). Once an array of targets is established – referred to as Patrol Points in the associated Blueprints – the Character will determine its own route between them. Although beyond the scope of this article, the use of Behavior Trees facilitates a greater degree of autonomous  decision-making. Their use will be described briefly later in this workflow in order to demonstrate the extendibility of UE4’s A.I. capabilities. Figure 3: Creating a New Character Using this approach to Artificial Intelligence in the context of UE4 requires several interrelated systems to run successfully (item 2 is optional): A Skeletal Mesh (the representation of the actor – the Character) A Behaviour Tree (the decision-making process used by the A.I. for greater autonomy) The Event Graph (which controls the actor’s actions, created in the Character Blueprint) A Navigation Volume (or Nav Mesh – the volume of the model that is accessible by the A.I.) An A.I. Controller (the default A.I. script, providing basic actor movement) Several Target Points (assets specific to defining a vector location in the model) A looping Animation Asset (a walking animation, assigned to the Skeletal Mesh) Figure 4: A.I. Controller Search In order to demonstrate A.I. within a UE4 model, a new Character will be created by right-clicking in the Project Browser and selecting “Character” (Figure 3) and providing a unique name: PW_Canora_Character. Using the same process, an A.I. Controller will also be created (Figure 4). In this case, a search will have to be performed as the Controller is not exposed by default. Renaming the Controller will follow the same convention: PW_Canora_AIController. This A.I. Controller will govern the movement of the Character, and can be modified to add greater functionality. Double-click on the PW_Canora_Character that was just created (located in the Project Browser – Figure 5). In the Viewport Tab, a new Skeletal Mesh will be added. Select the Mesh component of this Character in the upper left (Figure 6). In the Details Tab on the right, under Mesh, select the SK_Mannequin Skeletal Mesh (Figure 7) – note that the selected mesh must coincide with the animation assets to be used. They are often provided together in the same file and can be found in the Third Person Template.  Under Pawn, also in the Details Tab, assign the PW_Canora_ AIController (Figure 9). Figure 6: Select Mesh Compo- Figure 7: Selecting the Skeletal Mesh The required Target Points will be added. Under the Modes tab in the main editor window, conduct a search for “Target Points.” Select the asset that appears and drag it out into the model (Figure 10). This will act as an intermediate destination along a path of Target Points positioned throughout the model. The locations of the Target Points can be arbitrary, but is generally more useful if they define a path through the space. In the case of Canora Station, the path has been based on a sequential series of events, based on the objective of moving from the exterior of the station to the train platform. When another Target Point is dragged out into the model, it will be named “TargetPoint2.” Each subsequent point that is created will be sequentially numbered. This is to facilitate the A.I.’s navigation between the Target Points in a user defined sequence – not necessarily in the sequence they were created. Each character, therefore, may use the same Target Points, but in a different order. As the characters approach each other on the path, they will avoid a collision based on their Capsule size (the orange wireframe element in Figure 11). This Capsule Component is the collision geometry of the character. Figure 9: Assigning the A.I. Controller Once the character mesh is assigned to this actor, animation asset(s) will be defined. In the Details tab of PW_ Canora_Character, under Animation, select “Use Animation Asset” from the drop-down list (Figure 12). Then, at the “Anim to Play” section, select the “WalkFwdLoop” asset (this is a downloaded asset that will become available on the P+W servers – it offers a more natural gait than the default walking animation). The Target Points in this model were placed strategically so as to lead the character through the model in the order that an actual transit customer would use so as to simulate the project’s actual usage case: Figure 10: Conducting a Search for Target Points Entry Doors Fare Vending Machines or Fare Gates Fare Gates Elevator of Stair Platform Items 2 and 4 in this list define a potential choice that can be made by the A.I. This will be described in greater detail under Behavior Trees. Target Points have been placed at the above locations to facilitate guidance through this sequence of objectives. The PW_ Canora_ AIController serves to interpret input from the script in the character’s Event Graph in order to determine how to best move between these points, revising as required, in real-time. Once a sufficient number of Target Points have been placed in the model, the character’s Event Graph can be scripted. Figure 11: Default UE4 Skeletal Mesh and Collision Geometry Under the Event Graph tab of the PW_Canora_Character asset, a script will be written in Blueprints that will dictate this A.I.’s actions and behavior. It is here that the real-time adaptability of the character will be established. Two of the existing three nodes may be deleted, only the “Event BeginPlay” node will be used in this approach. The purpose of this node is to execute the script which follows when the compiled model in launched (or when simulated in the editor). The Blueprint script in it’s entirety is shown (Figure 13) with notes indicating the purpose of each node. Figure 12: Assigning Animation Assets to the Character In summary, this script indicates that when launched, the A.I. will move to a point within the Target Point Array (Figure 14). The order in which the points are reached is determined by the order in which they appear in the array (the list numbers on the left). Once it has reached a point, it will perform a check to determine if it has reached the final Target Point (based on the length of the array – in this case 9 Target Points). If it has reached the end, it will begin the process again. If it has not reached the final Target Point, it will proceed to the next point indicated within the array. Similarly, if the next Target Point in the array cannot be reached (due to an obstruction, another character, or the user), it will move to the next reachable Target Point. It will perform this check each time it reaches a Target Point. As stated, this allows many characters to use the same Event Graph and the same Target Points simply by changing the order of the points in the array. They will all avoid both dynamic and static obstacles. In order to improve the performance of the A.I.’s actions, an element of choice can be implemented using Behavior Trees. When a Behavior Tree is executed, the logic begins at the top (the Root) and runs down the hierarchy from left to right. This process will allow the A.I. to choose 1 of 2 “tasks” randomly using a Selector Node which will reference two integers (1 or 2). Figure 13: The A.I. Script A schematic plan of PW_Canora_Character’s Behavior Tree is shown (Figure 15). It indicates the process of moving through the station and where the opportunities for choice arise, reflecting actual usage conditions in order to generate more accurate crowd simulations involving multiple characters. It states that a random choice will be made (represented by the integers 1 or 2) when the character reaches a specific Target Point. At this point, a decision will be made regarding how to proceed. The character’s Behavior Tree was scripted in the following manner to allow this choice (Figure 16). The Selector Node branches into two tasks, each representing an integer – and in turn, representing moving to the Fare Vending Machines, or moving directly to the Fare Gates. Referencing the character’s Event Graph, it will move to the Target Point related to either of these 2 choices. Within the Selector Node is an Event Graph which establishes the parameters of this choice. It includes a reference to the random integer range. Additionally, the Behavior Tree will also integrate with the character’s Event Graph (in terms of cases when the next Target Point in the array cannot be reached) to implement other animations. The schematic Behavior Tree indicates that an idle animation will be triggered when a Target Point cannot be reached, based on the choice made by the character previously. Therefore, as the character “waits” for the Target Point to become accessible, it will enter the idle animation. This animation will transition into the walking animation once the Target Point becomes accessible. This behavior facilitates the random formation of queues at certain points in the model, such as at the Fare Vending Machines, Elevators and possibly the Fare Gates.

    "content": "There may be much more to Digital Practice’s Material library than you realize. A quick look at the library shows a substantial number of materials; however, these are only a small portion of the materials available. With few exceptions, each material contains 5 to 16 pre-created variations of the material within it. Some of these materials have exposed textures and patterns allowing you to replace them with your own tileable images. For Example the Material Stone_Granite_Polished #2 in the image below holds 14 different materials within it. 14 of the materials are shown in the drop down list and 12 of the are represented as thumbnails to the left. This material example represents differences in color and pattern brought about by the texture ma used to define the materials. Other materials have distinct pattern differences. To demonstrate this the material Masonry_Brick_Red is show below with the five different materials defined within it that display distinctly different patterns. All of these materials contains one or more color swatches to create new material variations. And these are not just any color swatches. Unique to vMaterials these color swatches function as ‘what-you-see-is-what-you-get”, a.k.a. wysiwyg (pronounced “wizzy wig”) which greatly reduces the time and effort needed to achieve just the right color in your visualizations. The example below using the Masonry_Ashlar_Interlocking material is especially difficult. It purposefully creates a distinct color variation from the color swatch. Despite this you can see the color swatch select for both the stone and mortar remain relatively close to their chosen color swatch . In February, Digital Practice made the decision to divide\nthe original vMaterial library into 16 smaller .mat libraries found here .\nThis decision was made to ensure shorter library open times within 3ds Max. To\nassist with exploring and creating your own new vMaterials three shaderballs\ncan be found in the same folder as the vMaterial libraries. Digital Practice\ncreated three distinct types of shaderballs for exploring solids, liquids and\nfabrics. Now that vMaterials are faster to access and there are shaderballs for reviewing them we want to ensure anyone interested knows how to get the most out of vMaterials. Using the Slate Material Editor in 3ds Max open one one the vMaterial libraries. Then drag a material to the View1 tab in the middle area. Double click the blue portion of the materials title to apear in the   are brief instructions on where to find the pre-created materials with each vMaterial, how to swap texture maps and examples of wysiwyg color swatches.",

    "content": "Program\nOverview The Virtual Design+Construction program, is a project centered collaborative initiative to validate and assist in the coordination of design elements prior to the issuance of Contract Documents. Throughout the implementation of this process, the model geometry is relied upon to inform the review process and operate on the understanding that the model will provide the base geometry for the contract deliverables. This program is being implemented to reduce the burden of construction administration, reduce RFI’s, Change Orders, E&O, and to improve the efficiency of downstream trade partners. Goals The primary goals of\nthis process are to: Validate the constructability of the design by visually understanding the spatial and sequencing requirements of design elements. Validate the design intent by visually understanding the relationship of pre-planned elements. Validate space allocations for disciplines by analytically quantifying spatial conflicts of modeled elements. VDC Foundational principles Firm\nDeliverables All firms will be required to post at regular intervals both their current Revit model and Navisworks Cache Files exported from the views defined above.   All firms will be required to participate in the coordination process and a project manager for each discipline should be present for the VD+C coordination the review meetings.  All firms will be expected to work diligently between review cycles to resolve issues identified. Navisworks Design Coordination Constructability Review Deliverables At defined intervals in conjunction with progress postings, Perkins+Will will analyze the constructability of the design models.  This analysis will be focused on identifying areas or elements that could result in an RFI being generated, a Change Order being submitted, or a Claim being filed. Following the Constructability Analysis, Perkins+Will will schedule a Constructability Review meeting with the other design partners to review the results. Revit Model\nRequirements In order to streamline the VD+C analysis process, the A/E team should set up specific views in their Revit models to export navisworks cache files from.   These views should be created using view templates provided by Perkins+Will and should be organized according to the agreed upon structure.  The consultant is responsible for reviewing the view and adjusting view template settings as necessary to ensure that the relevant scope of work is shown and that elements are not missing or hidden.   Perkins+Will will use these views and the cache files unchanged as the basis for the clash detection and constructability review. Roles &\nResponsibilities Matrix In-order to streamline\nthe process of assigning responsibility to coordinate or resolve issues, Perkins+Will\nhas developed a simple hierarchy based on the overall flexibility of systems to\ndefine in any clash condition who is responsible for coordinating the\nresolution.  This doesn’t automatically\nmean that the responsible party has to revise their model, merely who is\nresponsible for coordinating that the issue does get resolved.  For example if mechanical elements clash with\nstructure it will be the mechanical’s responsibility to coordinate the\nresolution, and while generally the mechanical systems will move; in those\ncases where structure needs to work around the mechanical it is still the\nmechanical’s responsibility to lead the coordination on that issue.  This allows the process to move forward with\naccountability and eliminates the potential for any one party becoming a\nbottleneck in the effort of managing all of the issues. Above Ceiling LOD 100 Above Ceiling LOD 200 LOD 200 Constructability Issue LOD 300 Constructability Issue Potential Constructibility Resolution Corridor Cordination Planning Constructability\nReview Planning & Scheduling At regular intervals and\nin conjunction with project milestones the design team will conduct\nconstructability reviews of the design models. \nThe design team should jointly define the milestones and review\nschedule, and coordinate this schedule with the VD+C team.  Generally, the constructability review should\ntake place immediately following a deliverable or progress milestone.  The last review should be coordinated with\nthe last milestone and the final deliverable such that adequate time is\nprovided to the team to make any last coordination adjustments prior to issuing\ncontract documents. LOD Milestone\nMatrix As part of the\nimplementation of VD+C on projects it is essential to communicate when design\nelements will be sufficiently planned, can be included in the constructability\nreview, and to what level of detail design elements will be shown.  Attached as an addendum is the Level Of\nDevelopment Milestone Matrix that the design team should review and updated as\nneeded based on project specific requirements, expectations, and conditions. Mechanical LOD Milestone Matrix Plumbing LOD Milestone Matrix Electrical LOD Milestone Matrix Fire Protection LOD Milestone Matrix Structural LOD Milestone Matrix By appropriately applying this process to your project based on its size and complexity you should be able to greatly reduce the risks of issues with the design and have a more comprehensive review of the entire design.",

    "content": "At the end of the day, there is just nothing more fulfilling than a great rendering that conveys your design intent clearly. There are some best practices dealing with the layers in Photoshop that can help get you there. This video takes you through our workflow at SHL when it\ncomes to post-producing visualizations, while also displaying the layer\nstructure we use in Photoshop. At SHL the renders are often made in-house and the common\ntool is Vray for 3dsmax. In order to achieve full flexibility during\npost-production, we render out many render elements in order to create masks\nand have full control of reflections, lights etc. Our layer structure is relatively standard in the\nvisualization industry and the workflow is simply starting from the bottom\nlayers and working our way up. It is a very structured approach but it\ngenerates speed, as the visualizer never questions what to do next or where to\nstart. It also means that we can easily swap or take over files from each\nother, as they are almost identical. And finally, we work non-destructive which means that we can always go back and the eraser tool is a no-go.   A thanks to Martin McSherry for sharing this information with the office.",

What should I do? As we update the servers the desktop client will begin to update on all machines that currently have Newforma.   This will be done silently and you should see almost nothing except a new desktop icon that says Newforma Twelve Edition.   You will need to close and reopen Outlook to get the new Newforma addin with the new features.   If you are someone that rarely reboots your laptop, PLEASE RESTART YOUR LAPTOP THIS WEEK IF YOU HAVE ANY PENDING WINDOWS UPDATES.   This will prevent a forced reboot during the Newforma installation process. New Features Generally, these upgrades don’t show any significant impacts on the interface or functionality you have been used to over the years.   All of the fixes are in the background with stability and performance.   This is particularly true for our external partners who will see almost no changes to the web interface or functionality of our info exchange with which they interact with us in our Newforma network. There will be performance issues in the speed of filing emails to your Newforma projects from Outlook.   There are also some unique email filing conditions that have been resolved and function normally now.   In addition, a new feature enables you to request that Newforma prompt you to file every email you send or you can request your team be enabled to choose how to file their emails all the time. Newforma Update The ability to use the Revit addin is now available for those using Revit 2018 or 2019.   This includes all the functionality that was previously there in older versions of this addin.  This was added in one of the recent updates.   Similarly, the ability for Newforma to properly read current dwg files from AutoCAD 2018 or 2019 now functions as well.   Recently they added a Navisworks integration that allows you to load clash reports into the system from their native XML export format through the action items activity.   This allows you to track the completion of clashes through Newforma action items instead of through a file/list from Navisworks or through future clash report comparisons. Additionally, there were small improvements to reports, right-click menus, meeting minute forms, synchronizing project information from Revit model files, the ability to index SketchUp files, improvements to indexing and searchability, external team members improved access to projects and info they are allowed to access, server database tuning for performance improvements.",

    "content": "For the past few years, Autodesk has adopted a release cycle where new features now get introduced in point releases a few times a year instead of just once.  The latest release which has been updated in our firm’s network continues to fix bugs in the software and improve the stability of the features we use to reduce crashing. While a lot of new features help our engineering consultants deal with MEP and Structure elements better and more accurately, here are a few things that will help us. Functionality to manage images in your model and place images loaded by an instance Removed the warning about elements to small so you can move objects very small distances Ability to zoom in on a schedule view in the model – this is done by holding the Crtl button and using the mouse wheel, to set back to 100% use Crtl and 0 More functionality around linking the topography from Civil 3D (typically used by our civil engineers or landscape consultants) Many improvements for cloud worksharing projects and model posting and hosting functionality These along with some of the previous improvements which are already available like multi-monitor support, aligning sections, background fill patterns, levels in 3d views, tiled views and uncropped perspectives make this the version your team should be on right now.   If you would like to see what else is coming soon take a look at the Revit public roadmap that Autodesk released. All new projects should be starting in Revit 2019 from one of the firm’s templates.   All existing projects should be making every effort to get their entire team upgraded to 2019.   Please coordinate with your consultants and other team members to find a good time in your project schedule to do this and coordinate any questions about the process you might have with your local design applications manager.

    "content": "ViewAQC (formerly known as DRU – detail referencing utility) has passed piloting phase with flying colors and is available for use on P+W projects. This tool enables teams to cross-reference views across multiple Revit models. For example, all details can be kept in a separate file(s) and called out from other models. The reference labels will be automatically updated when details are moved to different sheets or their numbers are updated, similar to how it works when you move a detail to a different sheet within the same model. This tool can work with any view type and is not limited to working with details and drafting views. It can also create intelligent text notes when referencing a view in a different model. ViewAQC has a robust user interface and project teams find it easy to learn. It has proven itself very resilient, with utilities to check, diagnose, and repair broken links as well as utilities to track changes. There are multiple project teams that utilized it in Seattle, Los Angeles, Miami, and most recently Dallas office. Feedback from  the latest project team: Tyler Ostrozynski (Dallas office) Our team decided to explore the use of ViewAQC as a means to bridge a workflow gap associated with split scope Revit modeling. When dealing with split scope Revit modeling in the past, the process of referencing views in other models was a tedious and highly time-consuming task, often requiring a greater amount of back-checking to ensure duplicated, non-associated annotations matched across the document set. We began implementing ViewAQC into our workflow in late SD and immediately recognized its potential as a time saver. Initial project configuration was fairly straight forward as there are resources and successful precedents available. The user interface is simple, easy to navigate, and reliable. With access to ViewAQC, our team can now cross-reference any view in any model and have the annotations automatically update as needed. This is a great tool for our studio as it lends well to our goals for efficiency and time savings. Having initial success with using ViewAQC, it is difficult to imagine reverting back to the old solution to split scope Revit modeling. We have recently converted our individual licenses into floating concurrent licenses which means that we now have the capacity to add  more project teams to the license pool without incurring additional cost Please contact your local Design Applications Manager or the Digital Practice team to implement on your project.

One of our Digital Practice Managers, Luc Deckinga, joined us in the LA office to host ADT as a special guest to talk about some advanced uses of grasshopper in computational design. Below is the recap of the work session. If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask Dean Demko and or Luc Deckinga. Digital Application’s Continuing Education ADT Topics Passing data into the GHPython node Type Hints Data Structure Access Getting data out of the GHPython node ‘out’ messages from the script Passing data to variables Intro to Python scripting Syntax Comments Importing libraries Variables If/Then Loops scriptcontext Rhinoscript commands in GHPython At the end of the presentation yesterday several people asked what Python allows you to do that Out Of The Box Grasshopper doesn’t. I mentioned recursion but gave a confusing explanation of what that is and why it matters. Here is a more detailed example: A factorial (!)  function works like this: ·         4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24 ·         3! = 3 x 2 x 1 = 6 ·         2! = 2 x 1 = 2 Factorial can be defined like this in Python: def fact(n): if n == 0: return 1 else: return n * fact(n-1) This function is recursive because it calls itself. Recursion is one of the two flow control mechanisms, along with loops , that give python its incredible power. Grasshopper users that have taken advantage of the environmental analysis capabilities of the Honeybee and Ladybug plugins have unknowingly been using Python, which was used to create those plugins. Because it is one of the most popular programming languages, knowing Python gives you access to a wide range of functions and libraries created by the greater community and enables you to connect to hardware and software that have Python application programming interfaces.

    "content": "Wrong Node Alert i s a P+W Revit tool that alerts the user when they open a revit file on the wrong node. The term “Wrong Node” means a user opening a Revit project on a node machine that does not match the city where the project file server is residing in. For example opening a Boston project (P:\\Boston\\…\\Project.rvt), on a New York Node (NYOCN0204) would cause the wrong node alert to pop up and suggest that you log into the Boston node to work on the Boston project file. The reason we care when a user is using the wrong node is because wrong node can causes some serious problems including: Slow performance: It takes longer to load a Boston file from NYO than it is to load a Boston file from Boston. Delay: Saving and synching to central may take longer than normal when working remotely. File Corruption: the delay in performance often causes corruption in the Revit file integrity, which will lead to unpleasant error message and major headaches for the project team down the road. Clearly, no one wants to corrupt their Revit project file. Often this happens unintentionally as people work on multiple projects from different offices and forget to change the node as they swtich between projects. They may have saved a few minutes for themselves from not changing the nodes, but as they corrupted the file by working on the wrong node, the team will have to pay for it by losing many more hours of work just to fix those errors. The moral of the story is don’t work on the wrong node, always match the node city with the project city and you will work smoother, be happier and live longer! What do I do if I see the Wrong Node Alert? If you see the wrong Node Alert. just Stop, Close and Change Node . Stop what you are doing. Close the Revit file. Log into the matching city Node (Open New York file on New York Node, Boston file on Boston Node….etc.) Just as a precaution, an alert message will be sent to the Design Application Manager of the office that are affected by your action. You might be getting a call from them soon. Options Close All Documents and Exit Revit : When only 1 document is open, you will see the option to close all and exit Revit. This option will prompt you to save and exit Revit automatically. OK and Continue : This option will close the pop up window, send an alert to the DA, but lets you continue the session as normal. When more than one document is open, this will be the only option given to you, since we don’t want to force you to close up any other Revit document that is still open. Kindly close the offending Revit file, and log into the proper matching node to re-open the Revit file on the correct node. Read More : Read more will bring you to this page on the pulse! What if I just need to copy a detail from my other project? Question : I’m working on the right city node, but I just need to copy a small detail from my other project that is not in this city’s projects, do I still need to change node? Answer : In this case, you can open the other project by detaching it, and that will avoid any problem from corrupting the other project file! and the Wrong Node Alert will ignore all detached file opening events. Note: Wrong Node Alert will only be installed for Revit 2019 and 2018. Create folder Add file Add comment",

In this case we looked at a collection of table families that were functionally similar but were individual families with fixed dimensions and layouts.As the Design App Manager for the Minneapolis office I strive to identify any opportunity to improve efficiency so I decided to tackle the table families. The following are the steps I took: Verified existing Reference Planes, Label Parameters, and Geometry Added additional Reference Planes and Label Parameters after flexing identified issues Separated Extrusions with more than one sketch for proper flexing Created new Seating Arrays Added the necessary formulas and visibility parameters so the seating can grow Good family creation can become great with a little extra controls.

This update has increased the speed and stability of the product as we increase our usage and reliance on it. Few things to point out include: better functionality with Autodesk BIM360 Design projects support for dynamo 2.0 tasks the ability to specify worksets for tasks You should have a clarity project set up for every project you are working on, right from the start. This will free up team’s time by automating repetitive tasks, like printing sheets or views for presentations or the document set as your design evolves. This way you can always have sheets available in PDF format.  Clarity can also help prep models for sharing with consultants and other external team members, and can even be paired with Newforma folder sharing or BOX to automate the entire process of sharing models (or other files).  You can also automate other exports that are necessary like DWG, Navisworks, gbXML or FBX Clarity has also developed some good model monitoring tools to help on monitoring the health of your Revit models and reduce the likelihood of crashes and other technical project disruptions in Revit.  Under the model metrics area, you can get a  real quick view of something you might be able to address to reduce those problems that we all know will happen right at a deadline. Clarity can also assist with model comparisons to help understand the difference as a model is developed, either before we are sending them to our consultants or the models we are receiving from them.   This is done through the model snapshot and model compare tasks, which can also be paired with the clarity add-in called Metamorphosis in Revit to graphically see this information. Make sure your team is taking advantage of all the features in clarity That will help automate typical project tasks and will free some of your time helping you focus on providing our clients with a great design.   If you don’t have this setup right now for your current project just submit a help request by providing the name of the project and path where the central models are saved.   If you already are using it but have run into questions or problems please refer to the Clarity microKnowledge cards we have on the subject.",

Enscape’s web standalone If you liked the Enscape executable standalone, you will be excited to know that you can now share your Enscape model via Web Standalone. Simply export Enscape as Web Standalone, then share the web link so others can view the model using a web browser. The advantage of viewing the Enscape Web Standalone in a web browser is that high-end graphics card in the computer is not required, so you can now share your enscape model just as you have shared your panorama images. Click HERE for the steps on how to export to Web Standalone. Asset Library Enscape is introducing their own Enscape Asset Library with contents such as accessories, furniture, people and vegetation. Once you select and place an asset into the model, Enscape will place a low-res version of the actual asset, which will render at high res quality when viewed in the Render window. Click HERE for more details on how to use the Ensape Asset Library. Adjustable Grass Can you tell the difference between the grass in the two renderings below? One is flat grass, and the other is 3D grass that Enscape shows in its rendering image. Enscape’s 3D grass always added more realism to the rendering. Now you can further adjust the height and height variation of the blades of grass. By simply adding the keyword grass into Revit material name, Enscape picks up the keyword, and renders the surface using the grass texture. Now, three more adjectives are added to enable you to adjust the grass material. In addition to the “Grass” keyword, “Short Grass”, “Tall Grass” and “Wild Grass” are also added. Visit HERE For more details on additional feature of Grass adjustment in sketchup. Faster Video Rendering Lastly, you can now take better advantage of video animation. The Video rendering time has improved by 6X! As always, don’t forget to PAUSE LIVE UPDATES when you are using the Enscape on the node! Using Live Updates on the node severly impacts the node performance, causing its performance to grind to a halt. To pause the live updates, simply press on the Live Update control, and the button will toggle to “Resume Live Updates”.  To refresh the Enscape window, simply close it and reopen it, and hit pause live updates control again.",

    "content": "Adaptive Components for Design and Documentation Many of you have heard about or worked with Adaptive Components in Revit. They are commonly used to place a family that adapts to a contextual conditions of your design.The Adaptive Components are built on “placement points” and these points can interact with other elements of your projects. Here are some interesting examples of less known  functionality of adaptive components which can make tedious tasks of design iterations and automatic documentation productive and enjoyable. Example 1: Placing simple adaptive component on the divided surface Example 2: Rapid design iterations and form finding for early design (competition) Example 3: Visually driven design, rationalization and documentation in this project the designers wanted a way to rationalize both the random pattern of the glazing panels, as well as a way to add shading devices to the mullions. And of course, an ability adjust everything till the last moment without re-work. The solution took advantage of Adaptive Components ability to “communicate” with other geometry and adjust. Designer just needed to move the “sphere of influence”, and the whole design would adjust. Documentation (panel schedules) would adjust automatically. Example 4: Documenting complicated forms Adaptive Components can go into your design, and measure and report the dimensions for effortless documentation in the schedules. Regardless what tools you have used for creating geometry, once the form is in Revit, you can use Adaptive Components for measuring. In this double-curved concrete facade panel, it was necessary to know XYZ in many points to manufacture the correct form. Rather than generating sections and dimensioning in multiple locations in each section, adaptive components were used to generate schedules for XYZ. Unfortunately, the budget was cut and we ended up with flat panels… Was still fun while it lasted. Example 5: Conceptual Design – Fifty Shades of Gray Adaptive components can have rules applied to them in order to create intricate and complex forms.  This interior project example has a prominent entry wall that the design team wanted to express a flowing form indicative of water.  The wall was modeled in the Mass environment, divided, and an adaptive component was applied.  The transforms of the component align to to a grayscale image produced for the project.  As the image becomes darker, the Adaptive Component becomes more rotated.  As the image becomes lighter, the Adaptive Component becomes flatter. What makes adaptive components so smart? They are based on the placement points, which can be hosted on any other family or project geometry. The distance and rotation between placement points can be parametrized, and used as a reporting parameter for measuring or in formulas to drive other parameters. They can be placed automatically using with repeaters based on divided surfaces, divided paths or both They can be placed programmatically using Dynamo or Python based on any coordinates of the placement points, or by selecting existing geometry They can be used to create family geometry using Revit massing tool set – for any  3D category ​They can automate your documentation process, so you can minimize re-work ​ Show me more of what can be done with adaptive components ! If you see an opportunity to improve your project proccess using adaptive components, please reach out to you local DA Please share your stories: adapt, divide and conquer",

    "content": "After DC’s VR Roadshow with Justin Benjamin and Tim Bakos (coordinated by local DA Dean Demko) visited Los Angeles back in late June, the Los Angeles office has had a number of success stories on many levels. Including, client presentations, client interactive design work sessions, internal design reviews, and internal model reviews. After Interior Project Designer, Tina Giorgadze attended DC’s road show she has adopted VR and began applying VR instantly. At the happy hour the day of the lunch and learn she was eager to get into VR and begin reviewing the medical facility she was in the process of designing. Instantly she found many design issues which she marked up in VR and took away a report to distribute to the team to make design changes based on her VR experience. After seeing the capabilities, which VR offered to design and its ability to give the user a greater sense of space, she then requested to use the VR equipment for a client meeting to review the furniture and materials. With advance notice, the DA was able to work with her to prepare a scripted experience, which worked in conjunction with the other materials she prepared for the meeting, including a slide show of renderings, floor plans, images of the proposed furniture, and material samples. The client brought a couple of the physicians who have been involved in the design process. Neither of them had ever used VR before this experience but were eager to put on the headset during the meeting. It only took a couple of minutes in the immersive environment of VR before they were completely acclimated to the navigation and controls becoming comfortable moving through the space. In preparation for the meeting, Utilizing Enscape on her local MSI machine Tina made sure the model was well prepared with clean modeling, accurate, materials, and lighting.  They were then able to spend productive time navigating the model and reviewing the design giving critical feedback. While they were in VR, there were instances where they commented on some of the patterns and colors, which Tina was able to update on the fly to show instantly other design options. They were then able to compare the material samples with what they experienced in the VR environment to get a full sense of the design intent. After the meeting, they stated it would not have been possible for them to comprehend the impact of the patterns and materials had they not been able to experience the space immersed in VR. This in the end resulted in a critical design adjustment for the client, which would not have been possible without VR. Another example of a designer influenced by DC’s traveling VR road show was with interior project designer Nina Lahham who was eager to get the client into VR as well. Nina contacted DA Dean Demko early in the morning the day of the client meeting. Asking if he could prepare VR for a client presentation. Even with such short notice, Dean was able to assemble the equipment within 30 minutes and have the model up and running ready to go for the presentation. Nina also had many other materials prepared for the meeting, including renderings and material samples. Once again, neither had been immersed in VR before, they were also first timers. They were able to comprehend the controls and navigation quickly, and within a few minutes were comfortably moving through the space and began providing productive design feedback, which was only possible with the VR experience. The client was so impressed with the VR experience they requested we bring the equipment to their office to show everyone their new design. A few weeks later, they brought the equipment to their office where, Nina presented the design to their office and afterwards they hosted a VR lunch session with Dean’s assistance. Utilizing VR in the client’s office was a great success, which brought everyone into the process generating excitement for all the client’s employees. Since then others have seen the success of the equipment, which now due to the demand the LA office has now purchased another Oculus Rift. The design director Yan Krymsky keeps one headset at his desk and the other one is used throughout the office on many projects.",

    "content": "Since March, approximately 3,000 render jobs have completed on our render farms.  An impressive number despite the machines in some offices sitting idle. The render farms are generating more content than ever, but they are not running at capacity. Are you in an office with render nodes being underutilised? Take a look at the pie chart below. It shows the number of jobs completed by office. Aarhus and Copenhagen actually dominate rendering so they were filtered out to allow other office names to be legible. If your office name does not appear in the pie chart the render nodes in your office may be underutilised. The render farms were introduced early in 2018 as part of the High Performance Computing (HPC) project, a partnership between Digital Practice and IT. The HPC render nodes span 24 offices and number 138 machines (see image below). Many of these machines are practically a small render farm unto themselves containing 24 Intel processing cores and 256 GB of RAM each. The potential rendering power of these farms is significant. The types of renderings taking place on the HPC render farms vary. Traditional renderings and animations make up some, but not all of the jobs. Also very popular are live renderings where the images remain on the working desktops of designers. Known as distributed rendering (DR) or distributed bucket rendering (DBR) this gives designers a faster workflow for progress renderings, which account for the large majority of all renderings. It also allows designers to render from our standard production nodes or cnodes without disturbing others on the same node. At present, this technology is available for Revit 2018 & 2019, 3ds Max 2018 & 2019, SketchUp 2018, Rhino v6, and Unreal. If you think render nodes may be sitting idle in your office, we invite you to use the links below to learn more. These past Digital Practice News articles address how to access our render farms and which rendering tools to use. How to Use P+W’s Render Farm Easier Visualization for All",

The LRT station was selected for this project because of the interactive opportunities it presented (such as the fare gates, elevators and escalators), along with their related animations. It was intended as a technical demonstration of how UE4 could serve the architectural field in terms of internal review, consultant/internal coordination and as a client deliverable. As such, the information presented in this writing is considered prototypical, and is current as of Unreal Engine version 4.14. This article will discuss the processes, workflows, and several exceptions to these workflows, as well as three Blueprint Scripts that have been implemented to improve the model’s functionality and UX.

    "content": "The relationship between design and construction is changing as both adopt more sophisticated tools to execute their work. The way these disciplines collaborate in the future may look very different than how it has in the past.  The lean construction institute holds a conference every fall and the presenters showed how the processes used by everyone on every project type could be more effective. One significant way that we can improve communication between the disciplines and reduce waste is to change the medium by which we deliver design intent.  We work in 3d during the creation of design, giving us a complete picture of the project.   However, we then lose information translating that model into flat segmented images of the project, organized in the traditional way devised before computers, put together by hand on paper.  When we convert our models to drawings we take a complete picture and make it incomplete.  We also take what could be real-time, dynamic information and make it static.  Contractors most often convert that information back into 3d models, a digital twin from which the physical building is constructed.  In the past, our only option was to create these drawings, but now we do this merely because of tradition, not due to the limits of our technology. We need to be more concerned with a handshake of information as we move from design and pre-construction to fabrication and building, instead of the traditional handoff.  This will provide us with the same type of quality control process that helps ensure that the design intent stays true as others partner with the team to pull all the elements and systems together that make a building.  This will perhaps bring the sub-trade partners on-board earlier to model and work with our architectural teams to finalize the design before construction begins. New tools (which already exist) will enable better issue tracking and coordination.  Data review, quality control, and the flow of communication will feel different, but more useful, with all the right people at the table working around a set of shared project information located in a common data environment. This is not the first time this conversation has taken place at our firm, or within our industry. Take a look below at some partners’ comments from the project delivery board on this subject a few years ago. Perkin+Will-Panel Recap from PW Digital Practice This transition from old to new delivery methods will take time and we will have some small hurdles to overcome.   We will have to consider all of our processes as the medium increasingly becomes digital models instead of 2D PDFs.    We will have to look at the language of the deliverables in our contract’s basic services.   We will need to think about what views are necessary for a model before we send it.   We will have to consider our quality control processes and move to more modern tools to check the information that isn’t easily displayed on a sheet.    We will have to work with suppliers to understand the submittal process, to obtain the elements of the actual prescribed items for your particular project.   Most importantly we will have to listen to the workers on site who need information to put the building together. They need to find ways to read this data and discover what format helps them build more efficiently. Just as internet mapping services allowed people to understand and navigate their environment in a different way, switching to a high-fidelity means of information exchange promises to enable workers to access information faster, resulting in more time for our design teams to achieve the accuracy they want.",

    "content": "The Event Earlier this year, P+W Miami participated in the annual Florida Educational Facilities Planner’s Association conference, also known as FEFPA. PW MIA attends every year for an Opportunity to connect with past, current, and future potential clients in K-12 and Higher Ed market sector. Typical attendee sponsors with booths consist of architect, interior designer, engineers, and vendors. Facility planners attend over a 2 day period and mingle with sponsors. Typically, our booth setup has consisted of a table, a laptop, and 3 banners. This year, the decision was made to upgrade our presence. This meant reserving two side by side booths, reserving space adjacent to the food and beverage booth, and showcasing the various technology integral to our design process. Next step was making a few decisions. Who would attend? What content would we showcase? What tech would be involved? Team Content Since the target audience would be educators and facility planners that narrowed down the content to K-12 and Higher Ed. We decided to go with two projects that we had built at Florida International University. FIU Science Classroom Center and FIU Robert Stempel College Complex. Projects were very relevant to our target audience Plenty of collateral on these two projects Professionally photographed Project was close enough to do last minute 360 degree capture for uploading to VX app and website Model was somewhat VR ready Both buildings existed in Google Earth VR which allowed us to virtually visit site Team members in attendance were integrally involved in these two projects. Tech In the end, we brought… …50 Homido mini VR glasses in PW Digital Practice branded boxes… …Wacom Cintiq 27QHD Touch Screen Tablet for navigating showcase project on VX website… …3 VR headsets for redundancy… ..3 MSI laptops. 1 to power a VR display, 1 to run the touchscreen table, 1 to run a continuous loop of marketing images… …The resulting tech combo… … and finally, 1 Herman Miller Magis Spun Chair. Things to Consider and Plan for Understanding audience. Vetting appropriate technology to showcase. Preparing for the unexpected. Redundancy. Get those software and hardware updates before the conference. Steam, Enscape, Revit, etc. Make sure you check out an Autodesk license. Plan your Wi-Fi access, or rather plan as if there will be no Wi-Fi. We had to pay $450 for 2 day, 2 device wi-fi access. Revit VR Walkthroughs Upgrading older Revit models. Prepping Revit models for VR Walkthrough. Downloading detached Revit models to 3 laptops. Export to Enscape project. 360 Project Site Panoramas Visiting site and generating 360 spherical panoramas. Coordinate in time with VizLab on uploading to VX app and website. Get the required approvals on VX content. Mini VR-Goggle Giveaways How many do you plan on taking? Unwrapping and re-packaging 50 Homido mini VR glass in Digital Practice branded boxes. How do you get people to take them? Engaging your audience Getting people to and into your booth. Getting people to use VR. Suprises Spun Chair was the biggest draw Kids and consulting engineer community showed the most interest in the technology. Gave away very few mini VR glasses. What Ifs Rethink booth layout to make people comfortable with engaging with technology. Bring our own hotspot.",

In addition to Revit 2019, we are also making available AutoCAD LT 2019, Navisworks 2019, 3dsMax 2019. Should I Upgrade My Project? In the last 2 releases, we haven’t pushed as hard for project teams to get upgraded, primarily because of the changes Autodesk made to text.  This year, if you are in an active design phase, we are going to strongly encourage you to get upgraded to 2019.  Here are some of the reasons you should consider upgrading:Our typical C401 contracts compel the consultants to upgrade when we do.You gain efficiency when you take advantage of the latest product new features and bug fixes.Many of our tools only support the latest few versions of software. Don’t get stuck in CA without access to tools like Clarity or Revit Express Tools.In addition to the Revit 2019 software rollout, the Digital Practice network has been hard at work in several areas to continue to weave design technology into the fabric of the firm .  Below are some highlights of what to expect: HIVE HIVE is our new way to manage and place Revit Families in our models. Hive effectively replaces 3 existing tools, simplifying the process of finding the families required for a project. It leverages modern taxonomy constructs to create a flexible system the entire firm can benefit from. Libraries can now be shared across the entire firm, giving designers access to much more content. This new system also allows for the quick creation of ad hoc libraries without loading duplicate content into the system. A group of Science & Technology leaders is working on publising market specific content. Based on the feedback from this summers pilot teams we are excited to share this tool with all of our studios this fall. Click here for more info. Revit Template Rebuilds rebuild all of the Revit templates in the firm from scratch, per Autodesk recommendation on a 2-3 year cycle. MicroKnowledge The Perkins+Will mK Website is constantly being updated with quick “How-tos” which will include many of the new solutions and features indicated in this article. Check it out! Dynamo 2 All instances of Dymamo on our nodes will be upgraded to version 2.  Dynamo 2 is chaulk full of improvements which will benefit the firm.  It is important that script creators are aware that Dynamo 2 introduces a JSON replacement of the old XML file format, causing scripts that are saved in Dynamo 2 to be upgraded and incompatible with old versions of Dynamo.  All scripts should be verified to work in the new version.

Nirvik Saha, a Ph.D. candidate in Georgia Tech’s computer science program and a member of Perkins+Will’s research group, along with Urban Designers in our Toronto office, have created a plugin for Rhino to generate building masses on all parcels in a master plan design. This gives the designers a detailed understanding of how their design decisions at the city scale affect the buildings that will eventually occupy that urban fabric. The team developed a general definition for how to create a building from a site boundary by combining the city of Toronto’s planning code with the design team’s desires for a ‘podium and tower’ typology. The script, written in Python, is executed via the Rhino command line. Dimension parameters are input through a pop-up window. The geometric inputs are pulled from specific layers in the Rhino document. This tool fits nicely in the middle of two existing computational tools in the Perkins+Will Urban Design arsenal, the Plan Builder and Area Calculator Grasshopper scripts. Plan Builder generates parcels from road centerlines and right of way dimensions. Area Calculator generates floors from building masses and floor to floor heights and measures the area of those floors. The addition of this building massing script gives Urban Designers a workflow that produces floor areas and building masses, using road centerlines as the only geometric input. That’s what I call a Parametric City.

    "content": "Many of you are already using Keynote Manager Plus Revit plugin . It was implemented firm wide back in April ( https://pulse.perkinswill.com/content/111799) and is being succesfully used on many projects. This new update introduces new productivity features which will help with QA/QC . and once rolled out, will be available in Revit 2016,2017,2018, and 2019 ​New version of KM+ now allows keynote reporting. Keynote reports show all keynote usages in the project. Keynote Reports can be exported to many common formats including Excel, csv, and pdf for archiving and analysis. While using reporter interface, you can group report by columns and jump to the view containing the element in Revit. KM+ now shows different icon colors based on the usage; black for used only in parameter values (not tagged), purple for used in tags but not placed on sheets; and orange for placed on sheets. Predefined searches now include ‘On Sheet’ and ‘Not On Sheet’. Renumber allows numbering by increments other than 1 .  For example you can set the starting value to 100 and increment to 10 in order to renumber to 100, 110, 120, 130, etc. Renumber can be done recursively to the full depth of it’s branch.  Keynote Manager will use the matching portion of the key value to do an update.  For example, if you have a note number 08500 with a sub-note of 08510 and a sub-note to that of 08510.1 and you renumber the top level to 08600 with full depth checked 08510 and 08510.1 will be renumbered to 08610 and 08610.1 respectively. In addition to Keynote Manager improvements, we have another addition (in beta now) to our tool belt. The idea came from Marko Goodwin, a spec writer in NY office. At the end of the process, he wanted to see and compare keynotes in the projects with keynotes in in multiple DOCX files (specs). One can extract keynotes from Revit in many different ways, but this little utility alows users to “scrub” .DOCX files for anything that looks like a Keynote . The search patterns is adjustable, and we can have many selectable patterns if needed. Marko said that what used to take a week of work, now can be done in 15 min Let us know if you have any other suggestions for improvements.",

    "content": "One of the most toxic warnings in Revit looks very innocent: something or other is “slightly off axis and may cause inaccuracies”. But just because it contains the word “slightly”, you cannot assume that it is OK. It is like saying “you are slightly dead”. I compare the project with “slightly off axis” issue with the person having scoliosis – it is a painful condition which gets progressively worse if not adressed early. It is painful for the project to have scoliosis and it gets worse quickly. PLEEEESE, fix items that are slightly off axis right away. If you do not, Revit will try to create other elements parallel or perpendicular to them, and soon you may have much more off-axis elements to fix. They multiply quickly! The main problem with “slightly off axis” is that you can not dimension .Revit dimentions works between parallel objects, and when even one of them is “slightly off axis” you have a problem. Faking dimensions by using detail lines may work occasionally but they become inacurate when design changes. Once you have one misaligned element, it will generate other misaligned element because as you create elements in Revit, they try to align to existing elements Revit considers elements ro be “slightly off axis” if they are at an ange smaller then 0.2 degree to vertical or horizontal directions.  It is rare that those angles designed intentionally, so where these warnings are coming from? Most often they come from linking or importing CAD plans to trace the walls or pick the grids. To prevent this, you should check “Correct lines that are slightly off axis” when linking CAD. One exception: site survey – here things can go in all different directions with small angles Existing conditions building models coming from surveyors may have those warnings, and they need to be resolved or consiously accepted when these angles really exist and matter. On the long walls even small angle makes a differerence.  However most important are the grids, because you may want to copy them into your design if you have ignored 20 miles warning, you are back to doom and gloom scenario, including misalignment. see I Know What You Did Last Model: 20 Miles Warning These are most severe “slightly off axis” warnings. which spread quickly to other elements as your model develops. Grid (or reference plane) is slightly off axiis and may cause inaccuracies. Problems with dimension between mis-aligned grids in plan Since grids are a foundation of later geometry, they need to be fixed first! ​Wall is slightly off axis and may cause inaccuracies . Problems with wall dimensioning in various views The curtain wall might not embed into the host wall. To fix, use align tool or align manually.

    "content": "Have you ever wondered why someone who is looking at your visualization has missed what you thought was a clear concept? Have you ever wondered why in the heck is the person looking at this image is lost looking in the corners? There has been some budding research by a few visualization companies using eye-tracking software to figure out those very questions. The one in the link below is from Brick Visual and tested various images on a group of people consisting of 3D artists and non-3D professionals. Note, that this study is slightly different than the one MIR did a few years back comparing architects to non-architects when looking at architectural imagery. More on that study is at the bottom of this page. https://brickvisual.com/eye-architecture-visualization/ The video at the bottom of the study is pretty interesting to watch. When nothing catches the viewers eyes, they tend to look at the middle of the screen until a visual queue tells them to look somewhere else. If you skip to this video, just note that red means the most viewed spots. In the end, they found out that as humans we like to look at other humans the most. However, the people in the scene do not detract from the architecture, they provide engagement. That is, of course, if the people are properly placed in the scene. The 2 absolute, brought down from the mountain by Moses Charlton Heston, set in stone, do not ever violate these basic rules of adding people into your scene are:1.       Never ever have the person placed in the image looking directly back at the viewer. This creates an insane level of discomfort in the viewer and, depending on the space, makes the person added to the rendering look like they are wondering why you are taking a picture of them. 2.       Sunlit people in an interior space with no natural light. Why does that person look like they have the rays of God shining on them in this basement space with no natural light source? Did they stand in front of the microwave too long or do they just have a glowing personality? Finally, this is a really good overview of what it takes to properly place people into a render by Arui9. I highly suggest checking out Arqui9’s whole YouTube channel. They have some excellent tutorials on there. This is an interesting topic to me because as a rendering team in Denver we are looking at why our exterior renderings just don’t have the same punch as our interior renderings. Looking at studies like this seem to confirm my thought that while we spend 98% or more of our time designing the exterior of the building, that’s not necessarily what sells the image. We spend all of our time on the building but devote very little time and thought to the site, to the landscape architecture, to the surroundings. Yet, it is all of those elements that provide context as to why that building is there in the first place. A perfectly designed building doesn’t look very well sitting in the middle of a barren concrete pad. In an exterior rendering, you can think of the building as the lead actor in a film, but all of the elements around that building should be considered as the director of a film. The director is telling the actor what to do, why they are there, what is going on around them. When doing an interior rendering, you are almost forced into the need to provide basic context or else the emptiness of the space becomes much more noticeable. However, we still do not provide enough context in most of our interior scenes. We’ll put tables in a scene, but not human accessories on the table. If you have a suite level club rendering full of people, but all of the table tops are completely empty, that just doesn’t visually connect with the story you are attempting to tell. That being said, taking a rendering to this level requires the proper time to do it. In rendering for architecture in general, we all know time is usually limited so maybe not all projects get this level of detail. However, on those projects that we determine are our marquee projects, we need to make sure we are giving them the right time to hit that level. The MIR study, Julia D Schlegel partnered with the visualization studio MIR to see how architects view their imagery versus your everyday layperson. The results are a little suprising in that architects tend to focus on the building only and your layperson tends to see the whole image.",

    "content": "Digital Practice has adapted nVidia’s vMaterial library for use with V-Ray for 3ds Max and V-Ray Next for 3ds Max. vMaterials are a library of physically accurate materials created by nVidia in the Material Definition Language (MDL) format. The library contains 63 materials with each material having one to more than a dozen material variations built-in as presets creating a total of between 350 and 400 materials. How Are vMaterials Accessible to V-Ray? MDL is the original file type for nVidia’s vMaterials. Chaos Group worked with nVidia to create a special V-Ray material  for use with 3ds Max called VRayMDLMtl. The VRayMDLMtl material allows the MDL material type to be placed inside it and an some of its features, like color to be accessible to designers. Digital Practice expanded upon Chaos Group’s special material making more features available and thus expanding the MDL materials available for use with VayMDLMtl. This is how Digital Practice was able to gain access to nVidia’s physically accurate vMaterial library. Where to Access the vMaterial Library? The library is stored at S:\\_Firmwide\\Content\\V-Ray\\Materials and the filename is vMaterials.mat. A second vMaterials library is also housed at this location. Its filename is vMaterials-Chaos_Group.mat. The 25 additional materials in this second library were created by Chaos Group, but placed in a default location where few people would find them. Digital Practice has organized these materials into their own library and placed that library on the S:\\ drive alongside other material libraries. Features That Make vMaterials Different Color control and preset variations are two unique and useful vMaterial features. Changing the color of a material is not new. What makes vMaterials different is how easy it is to get the final rendered color for the material in the scene. This is because the color swatch selectors function as a what you see is what you get (WYSIWYG).Another aspect to vMaterials color manipulation is the frequency of materials to have separate color manipulation for different portions of the material. While this feature may sometimes be found in non-vMaterials it is common to find it in vMaterials. When combined with the WYSIWYG color swatch selectors this features shines and is most noticeable in materials with district patterns.Similar to Revit Families and Family Types each vMaterial may contain numerous types or material presets found under the material’s dropdown parameter called ‘mdl material’. All of the vMaterials created by Chaos Group have only one preset. Most of the vMaterials created nVidia have numerous presets. The presets typically change colors, but some change more than color. What is Needed to Open and Render with the vMaterial Library? In September Digital Practice and IT will work together to push setting to the render nodes and computational nodes while providing and designer initiated install for MSI laptops and visualization workstations. In the meantime if you would like to explore these materials on your visualization machine, contact Dan Chasteen to get set up. C",

    "content": "HIVE is our new Revit Content Management System. It effectively replaces 3 existing tools, simplifying the process of finding the families required for a project. It leverages modern taxonomy constructs to create a flexible system the entire firm can benefit from. Libraries can now be shared across the entire firm, giving designers access to much more content. This new system also allows for the quick creation of ad hoc libraries without loading duplicate content into the system. A group of Science & Technology leaders is working on publising market specific content. Based on the feedback from this summers pilot teams we are excited to share this tool with all of our studios this fall. So what is the latest scoop? How can you get your hands on it? At this time we wil be focusing on using HIVE for Revit content: loadable and system families, schedules, drafting views, entire sheets of details. etc. On September 8 we are rolling out Autodesk 2019 product lineup, and HIVE will be a part of this rollout. But do not worry if your project is still in 2018 – we will make HIVE available in Revit 2018 and publish current BIMList libraries for 2018. So for 2018 projects we will have both BIMList+CrossDatabase search and HIVE coexisting. For projects starting in Revit 2019, BIMList will not be available. Below is a conceptual overview of HIVEs orginization system . Develop assets locally and share firm wide – Designers can search across all libraries seamlessly Store locally and/or on the cloud – ability for designers to get content without being connected to the P+W network and share content with external teams. Revit metadata search – automatically captures Revit categories,parameters and properties as metadata Custom tagging – tagging extends the taxonomy, creating ad-hoc libraries for markets, project phase ,etc. Flexible intuitive search – “chair” “Haworth” will find only Haworth chairs, chair Haworth will find all chairs + all Haworth asset In the following weeks we will share more information, begin training sessions and more contetn will be organised and published.",

Friday, August 24th at 7pm Eastern, 6pm Central, 5pm Mountain, 4pm Pacific time and overnight at our international locations clarity will be unavailable during the upgrade process for a couple hours.   Please plan accordingly with your project needs. We have been using Clarity for over 3 years now and it has saved the firm over 92,000 hours which equates to about 16 full-time employees for those 3  years.  Hopefully, this time was repurposed back to design tasks on all those projects by the team. Even with all that time saving we still don’t have all teams taking full advantage of this tool. Getting your local Design Applications Manager or GTS support to set up your project in clarity is simple.   All you need to tell them is the path to your central files.   After that is completed, it will only take about 10 minutes to get your typical project printing tasks set up and running. This versions new features in clarity 2019 include: Functionality with Revit 2019 New dashboards for model metrics New scheduling dashboard to understand task server resources Check out last year’s new features here . Please be aware that this upgrade means that the functionality of clarity will NO LONGER WORK WITH REVIT 2015 PROJECTS.

    "content": "This months tips come from Jeremy Franklin, Technical Director – Interiors in Chicago office Here is his story: Hi all, I have been jumping around between a lot of projects lately, and I have observed a few items I wanted to send as reminders. Please poke me if you need more clarification, I always have time to answer questions. It is extremely common to have CAD files linked into Revit models so that we can easily show the existing core/shell without modeling the entire building. Please always link CAD files; don’t “insert”  them. But before linking, the CAD file(s) MUST be saved to the DESIGN/BIM/REVIT/LINKS folder (of the same project folder to where the corresponding Revit model lives). Why? A lot of reasons. Linking across different job folders is generally hazardous and risky for future broken links The CAD file always needs cleanup to assist with displaying properly (graphically) on our plans.  This especially includes purging of hidden and extraneous junk.  It is better to do that in a CAD file that is specific to the project you’re working on, so that you have a “master” version to fall back on, if needed. Link to clean-up method Linking from other folders is confusing to anyone other than the person who does it.  When someone is trying to help troubleshoot problems with the linked CAD file, the first place they go is the LINKS folder. Be courteous to your coworkers. If you’re linking from some other master folder, how do you know whether that CAD file is also linked into other Revit models? And then if you edit or corrupt it, you may be affecting the appearance of floor plans in projects you’re not even aware of… When you first setup a Revit project, take 5 minutes to set the Revit levels properly using a building section of elevation view.  Name the levels to correspond to the actual building levels.  Set the floor-to-floor height as accurately as you can. Link to more info about level setup When you first set up a Revit project, take 5 minutes to set the project north (and if necessary, true north) and graphical north arrows correctly.  If you’re not sure, look at Google maps to confirm north orientation.  The building orientation should correspond to true north in its direction in Revit, relative to compass north.  If this cocks the building at weird angle relative to your sheet, then rotate the project north to make the plan orthogonal on the sheet. Rotate the project north in Revit on the Manage ribbon tab / Position pulldown: If you need to rotate the plan 90 degrees simply to fit the sheet better, I would recommend rotating the crop frame rather than project north. Better yet, use Section Box and Rotate it. This way all you plans will be cropped and rotated consistently. Think about the plan orientation ASAP to avoid embarrassing situations like having north facing DOWN on the sheet (like in a recent project) Every plan, regardless of phase, needs a north arrow symbol for reference and orientation If true north and project north match, then turn off the “true north” visibility in the north arrow symbol like this: If true north is slightly skewed relative to the sheet, then leave its visibility on and rotate the true north orientation by editing the “degrees” parameter of the symbol to set it correctly. For example: If you rotate the plan 90 degrees to fit the sheet:  rotate the north arrow symbol to correspond, then afterwards adjust the true north parameter as described above Don’t be lazy about workset management.  One of the most common answers to “why isn’t ____ showing up?” is because of workset management. Furniture belongs on the Furniture workset.   (this hides them on other plans and allows easy half-toning) Linked CAD files belong on the LINKS_CAD workset. (allows easy master visibility control). Egress distance railings belong on the Code Compliance workset  (hides them on all other plans) Anything you model for renderings which you won’t want in the CDs belongs on the Rendering workset  (hide on plans etc) Thin floors which are added for finish tagging belong on the Floor Finishes workset  (this hides them on other plans) If you really absolutely need multiple copies of a plan floating around in the model (which I find questionable), please crop down at least one set of plans so the primary scheme is obvious to teammates.  I can’t tell you how many times I get a junior designer asking me for help and we are both completely lost when we open the model, because it looks like a bomb exploded…   that isn’t efficient for any of us. These items don’t take much  (or any) time to do the “correct” way.  Being in a rush to do things might save you 5 minutes today, but will cost your teammate 10 minutes tomorrow. Don’t be shortsighted.  Thanks for listening.",

    "content": "This month we continue our scary story series about mistakes in Revit  from which it is very difficult and costly to recover if not addressed early. Link to first scary story Imagine that you do not see any levels in any vertical view (section or elevation). This usually happens early in the project. You check visibility graphics and the workset for levels and grids is on, but still cannot see levels in the view. Resist the temptation to draw levels in any view where you cannot see all other levels! There is a very high chance that in this case you will end up with more than one level at the same elevation, and this can lead to a very messy project where some elements are hosted by one level, and other are hosted by other overlapping level. Your walls, rooms and schedules are not to be trusted after that! Fortunately, there is a quick and easy way to check and manage levels using Perkins+Will Levels tool. You can even resize your levels, and import and export from Excel. Ok, you say, but I still want to see the levels in my vertical views. The levels may not be visible because levels are finite planes and your vertical views simply do not cross them. Here is what you do: Uncrop your vertical view to make sure that the levels are not above or below cropping region Verify that the vertical views (elevations) are close enoupg to the building footprint so the elevation clipping plane reaches just behind the wall if you still do not see the levels, unclip the view temporarily to see levels, select all levels and Maximize 3D Extents. It will expand levels to the extents of your model geometry. Do not forget to clip views back, unclipped views cause Revit performance deterioration. Alternatively to unclipping the views, you can simply create the new temporary level,select it, then select all levels and maximize their 3D extents. Now delete temporary level and any view it has created. This techique works in any version of Revit, but the recording below was done in Revit 2019, where you can actually see the levels in 3D view. Wouldn’t it be nice to be able to see grids , rooms and reference planes in 3D too? Maybe in future versions…",

This has help us navigate the set a lot faster without flipping through the sheet numbers, you simply click on the call outs or section marks and with one click it takes you to the correct view, from there you can review, make comments, etc. 1. From the file menu; Click on “Batch”> link > new 2. Once Batch link window is open;  go to “add files” and browse to your folder (the easiest way is to add one compile file per discipline). > Click next 3. The window shown below should open, here is where you will tell the program how to create hyperlinks. If your files are name with the sheet number you can use search by  file name, otherwise use page region, click on select and draw a window around the sheet number as shown below. 4. After you select page region, the following window should open and you should see the sheet numbers on the preview. 5. Click on generate; this should create a list with all the sheet numbers, if it doesn’t you will need to create a new search. 6. If you see all the sheets listed on the screen,  then you can click run at the bottom on the screen. 7. Now you should have an interactive document that will allow you to jump between plans, sections, elevations, etc.",

    "content": "Collaborative BIM projects need coordinating and while Naviswork is a great tool for automating element clashes towards the end of detailed design and construction, during design, when things are more fluid, it is mostly used to highlight issues by visual inspection and walking the model. Typically this process is part of a coordination cycle where clash viewpoints are saved and compiled into a report that is circulated prior to a regular coordination meeting. While this has been successful, it does take time in federating models from Revit exports then identifying and marking up coordination issues. We have been incorporating VR into the design process for some time but coordination attempts with FBX exports and app markup tools have seemed difficult and cumbersome to track. InsiteVR recently provided a new software release that incorporates some of the workflows that we would associate with Navisworks, which sounded quite exciting. An initial upside was being able to export natively from Revit to InsiteVR and being able to walk/teleport the model in Vive was really intuative. Issues at real scale seemed easy to detect and could be labelled as a text bubble via voice recognition. You press a button, you say your comment out loud, the VR headset records it, and the app will transcribe it into text that you can attach to the elements in question – it’s almost like having your own Siri or Alexa in your BIM model to record your comments. These labels are automatically saved as viewpoints and can be navigated to simply by selecting as you would any saved view. After “annotating” a series of issues an invite was sent from within the hosting VR session to the project leader who joined and appeared as an avatar in the same model to review and confirm the issues were in fact issues. He was really impressed by the speed of both identifying and recording issues. We were walking the model via our standard office Vive set up and Ocullus Go but the same workflow can be shared across multiple VR devices or even laptops simply with a wifi connection and the InsiteVR app. This is especially useful for this project as one of our design partners is based in Italy. – Powerful Stuff ! We wanted to introduce VR into the design coordination meeting which was happening the following day but felt some 2D output to form an agenda and provide some continuity between the tried and tested Navis workflows would help engage the team. This is where the App really shines. Once the clashes are identified and annotated, a PDF report can be instantly produced that comprises of a saved viewpoint, an automatic mark up around the area where the annotation was placed, a comment based on the identified issue, timestamp and author comment. The report was tabled at the coordination meeting as an introductory discussion point and the relevant parties then opened the model in VR and discussed each issue by clicking on the saved annotation which teleported directly to the issue in question. The project is at technical design stage and those present were MEP, Structure, Main Contractor along with ourselves as Design Lead. Feedback received was that it was an invaluable tool and the team commented that some of the issues discovered by walking the model at real scale may not have been identified in Navisworks during visual inspection. The contractor in particular was a key advocate and has asked for us to take the set up to their offices so that they can demonstrate the process to their own supply chain. We provided additional feedback to InsiteVR requesting tool enhancements that will support this workflow such as custom reports / sectioning / layer control and transparency. The turnaround has been good, with the next release already incorporating the ability to turn off layers/categories and we hope more of the features requested will make it into upcoming releases. Overall it was a very successful pilot, that simplified what the team consider a time consuming and often difficult process, especially if the team aren’t that familiar with Navisworks. It also really helped drive project team coordination communication and we plan to utilise this workflow on other collaborative projects at the appropriate time durign the design programme.

    "content": "Thank you to Perkins+Will’s Los Angelous office for being our “VR Roadshow” guinea pig! Special thanks to Dean Demko for orchestrating the effort internally. This “roadshow” insists on a minumum of a hour lunch and learn, followed by a happy hour starting at 4:30 and ending around midnight (or until there was no one else to talk to in the office). With the help of Dean’s efforts, both events proved highly attended. Woot Woot! Thank you good Sir! VR Roadshow??? Tell me more 🙂 Selling Virtual Realitys value in the design industry should  seemingly be effortless, as its relevance has almost unamiously been deemed obvious. If you are inclined to agree with that statement, can you also confirm your most recent projects have utilized Virtual Reality? The poll noted within the animation below has been given to audiences across the country… Mind playing along and keeping your hand raised as it goes from question 1 to 4? Perhaps you are of the few who have their hand still up upon the completion of the poll… Alas, I would argue you are of the few… Why is it that we can agree that the ability to walk our designs as they evolve would be super advantageous, but when given the tools and workflows that allow for such inovation, we shy away? Our roadshow reminds you of the possibilities of vitual reality beyond that of an add service. It hopes to help spark an idea or two specific to an active project of your own as to how VR could supplement time consuming and costly efforts with potentially more practical solutions. The image below notes VRs applicability in all phases within the design process. If uncclear on any of the bullets within the mindmap graphic above, know that our presentation addresses most of them… The impetous for DC to bring our roadshow to LA occured when they feared they might be missing out in how Virtual Reality could assist them in their everyday… Not to mention, any opportunity for me (Justin Benjamin – Presenter) to talk, is an opportunity not wasted 😉 The images shared below were taken during our efforts in LA. If interested in having this VR Roadshow go to your office, have your local Design Applications Manager or Operations Director reach out to Justin Benjamin ( Justin.Benjamin@perkinswill.com ). Friendly FYI –  I will be presenting on this topic via a webinar hosted by NVIDIA on Wednesday, July 18 For more information, click the link: https://info.nvidia.com/perkins-will-aec-reg-page.html",

    "content": "Perhaps all of you have heard about Revit best practices. We emphasize them in training, promote them while working with teams, and document them in our microKnowledge site . But occasionally we see mistakes from which it is very difficult and costly to recover if they are not caught immediately.  Even experienced Revit users are not always aware of these dangers, and they can cause serious problems with our models. It does not happen very often, but when it happens, it means Revit disaster, and recovery/mitigation effort can add up to many additional hours of work for the life of the project In this new recurring topic we will tell you Revit horror stories which happened in a galaxy far away on some projects, so we can prevent future Revit disasters in PW projects. One of the worst case scenarios for a Revit project is when you link a dwg file (often a survey) and see the following message Ohh how tempting is it to click OK, which Autodesk made a default choice! DO NOT click OK! Click Cancel! Your project will be in serious trouble and the Whitewalkers will come after you if you click OK! It is not possible to fully fix the problems associated with this issue if you click OK and continue to work on the project. Workarounds will add at least 30% to your production time, and your model will not be reliable and will not be fit for use as a deliverable. This is pretty much a doomsday scenario… Here is more technical explanation from Autodesk There are many ways you can prevent this disaster, mostly by cleaning up the DWG file before you link them. Here are some of them. But remember the whitewalkers and ask a member of Digital Practice for help if you are not sure.",

    "content": "We are continuing to showcase tools created by P+W staff in response to project challenges. Adam Hamilton, the Design Application Manager in our Minneapolis office has created an occupancy heatmap tool which was initially requested for a Higher Education team. Here is his story. OccupancyHeatMap is a Dynamo script that was created at the request of one of our Higher-Ed teams to validate the Room Layout against a ‘Day-in-the-life’ document supplied by the Client’s Dean. The Excel Document was a day-by-day, hour-by-hour grid with which classrooms would be needed. The intent was to get good coverage across the floor plate and in stacking and identify any areas that had gaps in occupancy. Input from the client The tool reads from an Excel spreasheet (class schedule) supplied by the Client’s Dean. This document has days of the week and time of day and the rooms information.  Dynamo can read the Excel spreadsheet and produce hourly colored heatmap in the plan. The Tool Using the graphic sliders you can dynamically change the time of day or the day of the week. Set the Dynamo mode to Automatic and as these values are modified you can watch the plan, or a sheet with multiple floor plans, change Auto-magically. The design team was able to visualize the change in occupancy over the course of the day and week and fine tune the floor plate as necessary. This example is tailored closely to this projects supplied data but could be adapted to be more flexible with the data or output. Many similar projects can take advantage of this workflow and the tool to better engage the client.",

    "content": "The VRX2018 Immersive Enterprise Conference is a conference that brings together global business leaders from AEC, Automotive, Manufacturing, Engineering, Retail, Healthcare and more, it is purpose built for VR/AR professionals to network and share industry insights on how to drive VR & AR adoption across the enterprise. Leaders from the most pioneering enterprises and tech companies shared and discussed where VR & AR content and technology are having a real impact on training, design, worker collaboration and sales & marketing. I was also excited to learn the latest market insights from top analysts and investors on where the opportunities are now…and what’s coming next. Our AEC Panel had a mixed representation from all three sides of the AEC industry. Three of us represented the design side, myself (Perkins+Will), Cerise Marcela (Gensler) and the moderator, Nirva Fereshetian (CBT), were all from the design side of the AEC industry. Kurt Maldovan (Jacob) represented the Engineering side, and Hal Jones (Skanska) represented the construction side. Our topic was to share how VR has revolutionized the AEC industry. We began the talk by sharing our own background and how we end up working with VR and AR within our own companies. There were many similarities in our experience of working through the early days of VR and CAVE environment, but eventually giving up on the early VR/AR efforts due to the high cost and complexities that made early VR unaffordable and unscalable for all projects. It wasn’t until two and a half years ago, when Google cardboard and Oculus Rift were introduced to the world, did we see a renewed interest in the VR/AR efforts within our AEC firms. With the availability of these affordable VR headsets and software, plus the change in the consumer culture’s interest in VR/AR that the AEC industry was able to see a fundamental shift in the use of VR and AR across our enterprise. For Designers and Architects, VR and AR are a natural next gen design tool for our design team. What better way to communicate the unbuilt design work than to get into the design model virtually and experience the space immersively. Instead of explaining the drawings in plans, elevations and sections, and asking our clients to imagine how the double height lobby would feel like, why not let them walk through the space and experience the scale of the space themselves. Instead of looking at the space from a few set angles chosen for rendering purpose, why not dynamically walk through the model and conduct design review in realtime. We are seeing VR being used in all different stages. In early design stage, VR is used for spatial understanding and master planning. In Design Development phase, VR is used for furniture and equipment layout, material and lighting study and virtual mockup, and in construction development phase, VR is used for coordination with consultants and contractors. As a result of incorporating VR and AR into our design process, we are seeing high client engagement rate using VR, high project team satisfaction using VR combined with realtime rendering technology, improved design review process, and faster decision making, and in turn smoother project completion. On the constuction side, Skanska has been integrating AR/MR in various phases from initial pursuit, through Preconstruction, and into Operations, as well as exploring the integration of AR/MR into facility management.  They have formed a central VDC group that is focused on developing their XR capability, Their primary focus are in three areas, General design and constructability review , Helping project stakeholders make better decisions related to cost during estimating and Virtual Room Mockups to enhance or replace physical mockup s. On the Engineering side, Jacob is more or less using VR the same ways as the designers have. They are also exploring the AR potential of “see what I see” or phone a friend feature which is huge for remote site visits or assistance.  Being able to record the physical space and the potential design allows not only real time visualization, but review by others who can’t visit a site.  Pulling up data whether it be passive (like an O&M manual) or active (from sensors) gives a great future opportunity for new ways of operating and maintaining facilities. As for common challenges, we all agreed that having devices that are standalone and wireless will certainly improve VR adoption rate, just as the introduction of “one-click” software has already helped make VR a common tool that the designers can use to instantaneously get into the VR realm. Our AEC panel was a refreshing talk in the technology focused conference, where an earlier speaker from Oculus actually said that “Architects are still drawing on paper”. Many people came up to me aftewards, and thanked me for the talk and mentioned that even though they don’t work with Architects, they really learned a lot about how advanced the AEC industry is in using VR technology!",

    "content": "Below are Doug Green’s notes from the BIM Forum conference which\ntook place April 20-21st 2016 in Minneapolis. The BIM Forum’s\nmission is to facilitate and accelerate the adoption of modeling in\nthe AEC industry. If you have any additional questions or comments\nplease leave them below and we can get the answer. James Vandezande from HOK was the conference co-chair. Theme throughout – do what adds value to the project and process – “Is the juice worth the squeeze?” University of Ohio has a “Buckeye BIM Initiative” that might be interesting to look at. The Elliott Bay Seawall project in Seattle was presented by Josh Rogers from Mortenson.  They applied VDC from vertical to horizontal, 4D to show sequencing on a very restricted job site.  Made the decision of what BIM tools to use after analyzing the project and project risks. There is no such thing as an LOD (whether level of development or level of detail – see later notes) for an entire model.  The model is always a mixture of various LODs. “Perfection is not attainable . . . but if we chase perfection we can attain excellence.”  Vince Lombardi. The LOD Specification will be published for comment on June 20, 2016. Comment period will run into August 2016.  It will be a downloadable document and intended as suitable for all project delivery types.  The LOD Specification is a “dictionary” and the project and delivery method is the “story”. HITT Construction did a presentation on the use of drones.  Safety and planning are huge issues.  One of their drones had a battery that went out and the drone crashed.  To avoid injury, the fly zone needs to anticipate where the drone would fall if something happens to avoid injury.  A pilot license is no longer needed, but one does need the FAA exemption which takes time (seems to be several months).  Insurance runs about $1500. Holder Construction and others during the course of the conference discussed laser scanning.  The most significant issue is the internal issue: who on the staff actually does the scanning?  Do you train and have on staff scan specialists, or do you have the field teams do the scanning?  Significant issue to set up on a coordinate system, and file size is an issue.  Accuracy was discussed by several, not as accurate as one would think.  And buildings move so even if accurate at one point in time, may no longer be accurate later. Scans should be interpreted, but never imported into a model. There is often a disconnect between the model and the construction. It is much better to go from 3D to 2D for drawings. There was a very interesting “BIMForum Lego Experience” which recreated the challenges of a team constructing a building. You have to “cheat” software to achieve field reality. Buildings are “living breathing” and move and change, software does not.  A building is a “body in motion”. Design modeling and construction modeling are very different things. There is no such thing as a zero-clash model. Version 2 of the ConsensusDocs BIM Addendum was discussed.  For several reasons I do not recommend its use. The document now adds a “Level of Granularity” description which deals with dimensional accuracy, in addition to “Level of Detail” (the richness of the detail) and “Level of Development” (the completeness of the detail). A more detailed review by both legal and digital practice is probably a good idea to understand this document in more detail.  But of concern, it replaces the definition of “Contract Document” in the underlying agreement, has “check the box” provisions to over-ride the 2D documents, automatically adopts the LOD Specification, and in my view generally has too many “traps for the unwary” for less sophisticated adopters, who I fear could find themselves in pretty deep water without knowing what they are getting into. I believe it is a document developed by sincere and passionate advocates for pushing the industry to what they consider a better place, but it may not be connected with current industry reality. The document was called a “construction contract” and the “first in the U.S.” It requires “tech protect” insurance policies (we are exploring but do not have and many firms do not – no uniformity of coverage and questionable cost/benefit), contemplates the model actually running the building, operates from the standpoint of cutting edge things that are being done, but not commonly. RFI’s processed in the model. O & M manuals are embedded in the model. A new section on commissioning and turnover, BIM used for training the operations and maintenance staff, and on and on. Expands the design phase considerably, including constructability, life cycle analysis, VE, shop and fabrication modeling, tolerance requirements for digital fabrication, sustainability analysis, record model, conformed design model. It is unclear who tracks changes, or how changes are tracked. Retooled the insurance and BIM IP rights. There was a presentation regarding the use of the National BIM Standard put out by the BuildingSMART Alliance.  The National BIM Standard apparently tracks the various BIM Guidelines that different organizations are using. A lack of consistency was noted in that regard. All of them describe BIM deliverables. The United Kingdom mandates that public projects over £85 million must have BIM. The National BIM Standard is at version 3, there is a relatively small group of people involved and has reference standards. Version 3 includes new content:  “Practical BIM Contract Requirements”, a BIM Planning Guide for Owners, a Project Execution Planning Guide, etc.  Probably worth getting a copy. Who in the firm is tracking this? Pat O’Connor and another presented on the AIA Digital Practice Documents. Making the point that the normal disclaimer inhibits the use of a BIM and the expressed desire to get around that. The AIA documents set out a regime within which to share models. The E203 is the contractual framework, the G201 is the digital data protocol form, and the G201 is the BIM protocol for sharing models. The E203 has a “check the box” which allows either a selection of the standard type of disclaimer, or that the parties want to share models and will agree on the protocols and rules of engagement in the G202. The G202 is the broad stroke contractual standard and framework on how to share and use BIM. Models carry a lot of information that we do not even know is in the BIM.  For example we can use a placeholder to indicate a sliding door but not the exact kind of door.  So that is the general reason for a disclaimer approach, but a disclaimer essentially throws out the baby with the bathwater. The G202 says parties can only rely on what one says parties can rely on the BIM for.  That’s where the LOD scheme comes in.  That is, even if what is in the model appears to be a Level 400 if you say others can only rely on it for LOD 200 that’s all the parties can depend on.  Any other reliance is at a party’s own risk. The document sets out four steps that are fairly common in BIM development: Conceptual, Generic Placeholders, Specific Assemblies and then Details (note: the G202 does not use those terms, rather uses “Conceptual Design, Criteria Development, Detailed Design, Implementation Drawings”).  This does not correspond to the design phases. The G202 includes definitions of the various LODs (100, 200 etc.). LOD 500 is field verification. Of interest, there is a distinction between a “Level of Detail” and a “Level of Development”.  A Level of Detail is what it looks like.  A Level of Development is how much it has been thought through.  So even if it is a Level of Detail 400, if you say you can only rely on it for a Level of Development 200, that’s all. Especially note that deliverable models will have various levels of detail and development. During the Q & A sessions for the ConsensusDocs, National BIM Standard and the AIA Digital Practice documents, some interesting questions and points were made.  One person asked whether setting standards was just setting a level of mediocrity?  It was quickly pointed out that the industry has worked with standard for decades with no ill effect.  It was noted that the implementation of BIM in the U.S. has not really been very good, and that the rest of the world outside the U.S. is ramping up much more quickly. A representative from Gilbane discussed scanning, and said they use the RFI to simply document the discussion and decision that has already been completed, to memorialize it rather than using the RFI as the mechanism for asking the question, which I thought was an interesting approach. The Fall BIM Forum conference will be October 17 – 19, 2016, in Atlanta.  The theme is “What is the new standard for professional coordination?  Examining the changing standard of care for designers, contractors and owners.”",

    "content": "Jens Buch-Dohrmann presented his collection of Snippets, a set of useful functions for Grasshopper, on the last firmwide computational design call (video here ).  Since then others have run with the idea, creating Snippets from pieces of their own Grasshopper workflows. This article will show you what they are, what they can do, and how to install them. What are Snippets? Snippets are user-created collections of Grasshopper nodes connected together to create a common function. These functions are distributed as a Grasshopper plugin and when installed they appear as buttons in their own tab, just like any other plugin. Current SHL Snippets ContextPeople MapperTree MapperLandscape from Curves Create GeometryBaluster railingexperimental spiral staircaseGlass railingStairs toolCreate Grasshopper layersdecks from curvesdecks from curves (advanced)Rounded glass façadeWalls w. openings from curvesWindows from curves RenderRender Sun StudyRender Sun Study w.

When a Snippet is selected, the nodes that comprise it are placed on your Grasshopper canvas, already connected together. It is good practice for Snippet creators to include text notes explaining the inputs, outputs, and controls. Snippet placed on the Grasshopper canvas, click to enlarge How do I install Snippets? Grasshopper plugins come in two file formats, Libraries (.rfa) and User Objects (.ghuser).  Snippets are created as User Objects, where each function is a separate file. To install a User Object move it to C:\\Users\\<UserName>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Grasshopper\\UserObjects\\. Restart Rhino. But before you start copying files, read below to see how we’ve automated this process for easy installation. Snippet User Object Files One additional thing to consider in distribution; Snippets can contain nodes from other Grasshopper plugins, which means those plugins need to be installed for the Snippet to work. A script (Install_GH_Plugins.ps1) is included with each Snippet collection that copies the UserObjects, along with all required plugins, to the correct location. Consult the accompanying readme file for detailed instructions. Snippet Distribution Files: Installer Script, Readme, and Plugins folder containing Snippets and Required Plugins. We currently have two Snippet collections: SHL Snippets: O:\\SHL\\BIM\\24 Grasshopper\\01 Grasshopper distribution folder\\SHL_Snippets\\ Detailed PDF documentation included. Video Tutorials https://www.useloom.com/my-videos/SNIPPETS%20Tutorials Process Lab Snippets: \\\\perkinswill.net\\PWresources\\Research\\Process_Lab\\Grasshopper Snippets\\DesignSpaceConstruction\\ How do I make my own Snippets? Snippets are the product of a plugin called Metahopper that, as the name implies, provides Grasshopper workflow tools. Here is a video showing some of its features ( https://vimeo.com/176764658 ).  Metahopper can be found here (S:\\_Firmwide\\Rhino-Grasshopper\\Plugins\\Metahopper\\) or here ( https://www.food4rhino.com/app/metahopper ) Once you have Metahopper installed follow these steps to create your own Snippets: Select the nodes on your Grasshopper canvas that you would like to save as a Snippet. Go to the Metahopper drop down and select ‘Save Snippet.’ Set the Snippet parameters in the pop-up. ‘Category’ will be the name of the tab created in Grasshopper. ‘Sub-Category’ will be the group within the tab. Press ‘OK’ A new tab and group will be created if you used a ‘Category’ or ‘Sub-Category’ that didn’t already exist. A new .ghuser file for the Snippet will be created in the C:\\Users\\<UserName>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Grasshopper\\UserObjects\\ folder. Share your Snippets with everyone. That’s it! If you would like additional information or assistance using of making Snippets contact your local Design Application Manager or Luc Deckinga , Digital Practice Manager for Computational Design.",

For Champaign Cental High School, we needed to a way to organize hundreds of 360 images we captured while surverying the existing building. The 360 images were critical in understanding and documenting the renovation and new construction efforts.  The school was over 160,000 SF, comprised of the original 1934 building, with two addtions added in 1954 and 1997. Digging through the windows folder to find and view the correct image was becoming a hassle. We needed a visual, and intuiive way, to organize the 360 images. We found that Bluebeam allowed us to embed panorama images over the existing floor plan. By attaching to markup object, we could now click on specific rooms, and a pop-up would allowing us to zoom and pan around the image using the bluebeams built-in viewer. This has added a lot of value to our project, not only as a time saver, but as a way to share and discuss with our design team, client, and contractor.

Every project should take a few minutes to put this information together as part of their project work plan to complement the schedule and staffing for each project’s plan.   We have put together a new modular template that works for any project size and type.   This has been made simpler to edit and can be found in your word templates once your office has been given the overview. You can use this template as a basis to talk to your client about the goals for BIM and the scope of digital deliverables.   It should be simple enough to refer back to by the team over the course of the project to keep the team on the right path and to onboard new team members. The baseline template includes sections on; contacts, goals, collaboration procedures, file exchange, model plan, level of development, and right of reliance.   We then provided modules to supplement that baseline to cover topics like; Visualization and VR, QA and QC, Interiors, Computational Design, Design by Making, Data Management, PW and Associate architects, and Construction contract administration. Every project has a scope defined by what we need to deliver.   With that scope, we put together a team and define the schedule.   Please make every effort to define how the work is going to be completed in your Digital Execution Plan.",

    "content": "When Virtual Reality (VR) was first introduced, it was really designed as a single person experience. Only one person can put the VR headset on, and only one person can experience that virtual world all by himself or herself. The only way others can share in that experience is by peeking into the VR headset and stream the VR content onto an external monitor. Even though we may see what the VR user is seeing on the monitor, we are technically not in the same virtual world with him/her. Earlier this year, many VR applications finally began to offer multi-user meeting services. Using the multi-user functionality, you now can have a true shared VR experience with others in the VR world. Host your meeting in VR, invite your project team to join in from anywhere in the world, and you can all review the project by walking through the project site virtually together! Just as the word “Skype” has become a common verb refering to meeting online, what would the new word for VR meeting be? Will you be using InsiteVR or IrisVR? Let’s take a closer look at two popular software applications that both offer multi-user VR meeting services, InsiteVR and Prospect 2.0 (from IrisVR). InsiteVR ( https://www.insitevr.com/) InsiteVR released their multi-user meeting feature in late 2017, followed by a series of “ Immersive Projects Showecase ” where designers offer free VR tours to their virtual project model. With InsiteVR, the one click meeting invite helps you start the VR meeting by sending a url link to your attendees. Through the link, participants can join in using any kind of headset (Vive, Rift or Mixed Reality headsets) or even without a headset by using the browser and a keyboard. Once you join the meeting, participants appear as floating headsets and pairs of controllers with their names on a label hovering over the top of the headset, the movement of the headset indicates which way that person is looking at, and the position of the headset hints at the height of the person. The controllers show where the user’s hands are pointing at. Our brain magically adjusts and helps us see the invisible person that’s behind the headset and its controllers. Next, add voice chat to the session, and we naturally start to chat and interact with our invisible teammates in the virtual world. Parkin Architects Ltd. took attendees through their model of the\nElectrophysiology Procedure Room at St. Mary’s General Hospital in\nCanada. Jeremiah Hawkins from Schimberg Group in Florida. He guided a group of 10 attendees through the model of the Mar Vista restaurant. In addition to the annotation tools that were already available in InsiteVR, new meeting functions were added to help facilitate the virtual meeting process, such as “Broadcast”, “Gather” and “GoTo” functions. The “Broadcast” function is perfect for fully guided tour that forces participants to always follow you. The “Gather” function helps gather up all the participants to where you are located, so you can start the presentation or discussion with all the attendees looking at the same areas of the model as you are. The “GoTo” function teleports you to the location of a specific participants, in case you need to see the issue the participants is pointing at in the model. The “Capture meeting annotation to PDF” feature really helps to generate action items from your VR meeting. One important service that only InsiteVR provides is the ability to offer model navigation on mobile headsets such as Oculus Go. Using InsiteVR app on the Oculus store, you can join in the VR meeting using the brand new Oculus GO, a complete standalone headset that requires no wire, nor graphic PC to power it. This potentially could be the game changer, since the less obstacle there is in getting the user into VR, the more popular the VR tool will become. With InsiteVR’s 3 headset giveaway (1 samsung Odyssey and 2 Oculus Go) for each new account sign up, the offer is almost too good to give up! IrisVR ( https://irisvr.com/prospect) Prospect 2.0 from IrisVR also introduced the multi-user meeting feature late last month. Unlike InsiteVR where the project is cloud based, you will need to download the project file to open the file locally in the desktop app, but it works the same way with any headset and even without a headset, you can participate using a browser and keyboard (the avatar will wear sunglasses and has a keyboard instead of controllers). The avatars have rounded heads with headsets on and cone shaped body with floating hands holding the controllers. Each user has a different color avatar which helps you to differenciate the users without having to read their name tag. the user interface is nicely designed with easy to understand graphic icons. Our users were quick to adapt to the user interface and were able to sketch, annotate, measure, and change daylight setting with very minimum instruction. Prospect does have plugin for Revit, Sketchup and Rhino, so users of any of these software can easily jump into VR within a matter of minutes. Prospect works best with tethered headsets (HTC Vive, Oculus Rift and Mixed Reality headsets), it does not yet support mobile headset such as Oculus Go. As part of our firmwide multi-user VR meeting testing that I hosted last month, we held three separate sessions of multi-user meetings using Prospect. We invited users from all P+W offices to participate. Some office had the VR equipment setup and encouraged anyone interested to join in the VR meeting to try it out for themselves. Other offices had only 1 or 2 people join into the meeting. But we all met in the virtual model and had the chance to chat with each other and walk around the campus, tag the walls with our own graffitti annotations. and experimented all the fun tools on our tool palette. Some office do not have headsets available in their office, so they only joined in via a browser to follow the meeting. If you have missed the presentation in your office, please reach out to your local DA, and I would be happy to setup a VR meeting for you to try it out! Reach out to me if your office don’t have a headset, I can arrange for you to borrow one to try out as well. Here is a good anecdote on best use case for VR meeting. One of our project team in the New York office was in the midst of preparing a major client presentation that they were taking with them as they fly 3,000 miles to the client’s site, they jokingly said, wouldn’t it be nice to be able to meet on a regular basis with the client in VR, since they are so far awar? Our DA, Vina, responded, “of course you can! Give me five minutes and I will get your project setup for you to try it in VR”.  In less than 5 minutes, we had the two designers put on the VR headsets at the same time in the same room and they both walked around inside the model for an interactive review session. The team is excited for the potential of how this technology can help them keep their client engaged more frequently without requiring them to travel so often!",

    "content": "Rhino 6 Rhino version 5 was released in 2012, but the folks at McNeel haven’t been sitting on their laurels in the intervening years. They’ve made significant changes under the hood and added a plethora of new, useful features. This is a primer on how we will be deploying it at Perkins+Will, some of the most useful new features, and links to more information on McNeel’s website & around the web. Grasshopper 1.0 You read that right, version one. Believe it or not, this is the first official release of Grasshopper. It first appeared in 2007 and has spent the last 10 years as beta software, but a dedicated community of users developed plugins that kept it constantly evolving and improving. With its official release, Grasshopper is now included in the main Rhino install, rather than as a separate plugin. Otherwise, it feels comfortably familiar. Anyone who used the beta version will feel instantly at home. See below for some of the major changes. Perkins+Will Rhino/Grasshopper Deployment: No issues found so far in test files upgraded from Rhino v5 to v6 or Grasshopper files from beta to 1.0. Neither can ‘back save’ to earlier versions once upgraded. P+W’s computational nodes have advanced 3D graphics cards that can be utilized in Rhino. Yoga laptops do not have this capability, so this feature must be disabled by unchecking the ‘GPU Tesselation’ box in the Rhino settings, shown in the image below. If you do not turn this off you will see flickering when panning or orbiting the view and some objects are not visible in some display modes. MSI laptops have graphics cards and should not experience this issue. Perkins+Will previously managed Grasshopper plugins in two separate locations, a ‘Common Files’ folder that contained the most common plugins, and made them available to all users of that machine, and a ‘User’ folder that contained any plugins installed by an individual user. If both locations contained the same plugin you were asked which you wanted to use every time you opened Grasshopper. Super annoying. We will discontinue putting plugins in the ‘Common Files’ folder, meaning users will need to manage their own plugins by doing the following: Get plugins from: www.food4rhino.com the P+W Grasshopper plugin location: S:\\_Firmwide\\Rhino-Grasshopper\\Plugins\\ plugins included with a script you want to use Only load the plugins you are going to use.  If you load them all UI tabs get very compressed and hard to read. Copy plugins that use the .gha file format to C:\\Users\\<UserName>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Grasshopper\\Libraries\\ (most plugins are in this format) Copy plugins that use the .ghuser file format to: C:\\Users\\<UserName>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Grasshopper\\UserObjects\\ (Ladybug and Honeybee use this format, but few others) Grasshopper users must include required plugins when distributing their scripts. Links to the Rhino 6 new features sections most relevant to us: Presentation Best Change: ‘ViewCaptureToClipboard’ is the screen capture we’ve always wanted. Display Best Change: Out of the box display styles are much nicer Documentation Best Change: Make2D is better and available in Grasshopper Refinements All the micro-improvements that add up to a better user experience Grasshopper Changes Which Plugins work with the new Grasshopper? Here is the list of plugins that developers have confirmed work with Grasshopper for Rhino 6 Food4Rhino . Developers must individually confirm compatibility. Other plugins may work, or they may not. The popular plugins will likely be compatible soon if they aren’t already. Kangaroo physics engine Included This was one of the most popular plugins so they adopted it into the core Multi-threading being introduced gradually This means Grasshopper can take advantage of multiple processors simultaneously, increasing the speed of executing complex operations or working with large datasets. Only these components first , as a test. More to come later. Two-minute video in a soothing British voice explaining the visual cues on the Grasshopper nodes that indicate multi-threading capabilities.

    "content": "In the last few weeks we have rolled out two very useful productivity enhancing tools. Keynote Manager standalone and plugin for Revit Many of you are familiar with Keynote Manager standalone , which allows you to edit keynote file in a collaborative and streamlined way. Depending on your  office policy and project needs, editing can be done using Keynote Manager, Excel and/or Notepad. Regardless of your office process we recommend as a minimum to open project keynote file in Keynote manager to check the structure and fix problems. For example,  KM  finds orphaned keynotes, and also detects and helps to resolve duplicates. If your office process allows multiple people to edit keynote file, they can now do it simultaneously, all changes are saved immediately, but if you make a mistake, there is always a backup here C:\\Users\\%Username%\\Documents\\Keynote Manager\\Backups saved every 10 min. You can easily add keynotes of every level, renumber them, change hierarchy, insert keynotes from another file or from master file(s). You can also add comments and links to individual keynotes, compare two different keynotes files, compare with backup, and establish master-child relationship between the files to create a subset from the master file. Search is easy – with the search window and filters. Each new search is saved as a filter. Easy to convert all to keynotes to upper case, lower case, etc. And you can print visible keynotes , all keynotes or selected branches Keynote Manager Plus is a Revit plugin that in addition to editing keynote file (which may be restricted in your office or your project- please check)  offers many additional productivity enchancements. Here are some of them: Graphic indication that the keynote is used in the project and an ability to select all elements using this keynote or list them in the dialog box Additional predefined searches – Used and Unused One click keynote adding. Keynote is applied using current keynote application method Find a keynote for selected object(s) Apply keynote to selected object(s) There is also a keynote watcher:  feature that monitors keynote sources for open Revit projects and notifies the user of changes and/or reloads the keynotes into Revit. For users who are working on the Revit file while another team member is working on the keynotes, this allows them to ensure that their keynote display is up to date at all times. Keep it closed unless nesessary, it takes resourcesNote- we do not use cloud. Another great tool that was added recently is Invisibility Advisor Did you know that Revit has almost 60 different ways to control object visibility? Even very exprerienced users may spend a lot of time figuring out visibility issues. Add to it that there may be more than one reason that something is not visible… Invisibility advisor to the rescue! it helps Revit users to find elements that are not displaying properly and can identify the causes of invisibility as well as offer useful information and links to relevant knowledgebase articles for each issue. In many cases, Invisibility Advisor can automatically ‘fix’ the display of the elements depending on the reason. The process starts with selecting elements in question. View where you have visibility issues must be open, but you can also open views which show the elements in question and pick the element from there. as you open more views, you may need to hit refresh . If you cannot find the view where element is visible, you can select the element in the view you are troubleshooting from the invisibility advisor interface. Interface is modeless, which means that you can open and close view, and navigate outside of the tool without closing. Example the view on the left has following visibility issues: there are two banquettes where there supposed to be three stairs are not visible column is not visible Banquette Column Stair",

    "content": "Swarm Comparison Demo from PW Digital Practice on Vimeo . Are you already benefiting from P+W’s render farms? If not, keep reading to learn how. Whether you choose to render in Revit, Rhino, SketchUp or 3ds Max the P+W render farms are accessible through the farm’s management software Deadline Monitor. The V-Ray rendering engine is also available at P+W on all four applications. Those designers already using P+W’s render farms are experiencing a performance boost for a range of visualization projects. How to Use the Render Farm with… V-Ray for Revit. V-Ray for Rhino. V-Ray for SketchUp. V-Ray for 3ds Max. What If Deadline Monitor or V-Ray is Not Installed on My Machine? You may already have access to it on the computational nodes. If you have an MSI laptop or other laptop or workstation capable of producing visualization, then an install package should be available within Software Center (see first image below). The name of the install package is Deadline V-Ray Package (second image below). No V-Ray Licenses Available?! If this happens, please email Digital Practice . We are prepared to expand the number of licenses as the need increases. Unfortunately, the V-Ray license server software provides no log or other means of informing Digital Practice when the number of licenses are too few. We are depending on you to let us know each time licenses are unavailable. Thank you in advance. Why Do I Have to Use Deadline Monitor? The key or gateway to the render farms is an application called Deadline Monitor. This is the only way to access the render machines. Deadline Monitor helps maintain the availability of these machines for rendering, organizes past and present jobs, and maintains the rendering queue for everyone needing to render. P+W’s render farms are intended as a sharable resource. Deadline Monitor facilitates sharing. Can I Render from a Computational Node? Yes. To avoid negative attention always check the ‘Cap CPU Utilization” in Rhino and SketchUp or “Don’t Use Local Resources” in Revit when rendering from a computational node. Rendering Etiquette As a shared resource, it is important to practice good etiquette with others using the office render farm. This means splitting the resources for simultaneous use, refraining from escalating your job in front of others in the render queue and communicating with one another as needed. It is also important to clean up after your projects. Delete your old jobs once you no longer need them.  If your job has errors and you plan to request assistance from a Design Application Manager or other, do not delete the job. Deadline jobs log errors. These logs may help identify the cause of your error. Feedback Concructive critisism is alway welocome, but letting us know if our efforts have been helpful is important too. If you have a suggestion to improve these resources let us know. Also if our work has been helpful to you please share this. It helps us better help you. If you have a positive story share we would love to hear it ( email Digital Practice ). We may even feature your story in Digital Practice’s monthly ReCap.",

    "content": "The London office looked to the Perkins+Will digital toolset to help become a differentiator in a – one of two – final bid stage, for a S&T project in middle England, Oxford. As part of the client presentation the concept designed Rhino model was made available in Virtual (VR) and Augmented (AR) Realities via Enscape and Microsoft Hololens respectively. During the presentation it was the Hololens that captured the interest of the client stakeholders with all 5 of our guests viewing the scheme, asking questions about technology use and most importantly, the projects design. Due to a tight timeline no further interaction was built into the AR model but doing so will only make the experience more engaging and is something that the London office will develop for subsequent Architectural presentations following the success of this project taster. The feedback from the client team was extremely positive and London CCC Head, John Drew sees AR as a “game changer”, “ having the capability of being able to literally place the building in the real world will help communicate and answer all sorts of project questions from communication and design validation to decision making and planning constraints. The fact it is almost pocket sized, makes it both a portable and powerful presentation tool.“ While the workflow from design model to AR is not as instant as VR the step by step process from Rhino export, to Unity, to Visual Studio, to Hololens deployment is fairly straightforward, the biggest challenge was ensuring the hardware and software builds between platforms were compatible. Fortunately, we were able to draw on the experience of Digital Practice Reality guru, Iffat Mai, to help make this possible in the short timeframe we had between finished design model and port to Hololens. While we wait for a final decision on this particular project we will continue to push projects into this environment and with a subsequent release of Hololens 2 on the horizon we see it as an important and exciting part of the London office digital tool set.",

    "content": "Perkins+Will has developed a robust Revit ecosystem which include templates, workflows, loadable and system content. The content steering group of Perkins+Will Digital Practice works to improve and coordinate content and template delivery to the entire firm. The group met for a 1.5 day workshop to evaluate the current state of our Revit ecosystem, identify inefficiencies, and plan improvements. The workshop participants were Josh Moore (DAL), Adam Hamilton (MIN), Chris Coscia (BOS) and Helen Gorina (NYC).  We focused on the following two major areas. Content distribution system Currenly we are using BIMList server supplemented with CrossDatabase search to distribute content to project teams.  In almost three years of use, the amount of content we have to maintain and intelligently distribute to different  offices/market sectors/projects grew to a point that lessens current system efficiency. Meanwhile, there are other solutions which emerged  and matured recently that have potential to dramatically improve our content distrubution workflows. In recent months we have evaluated several of those systems. We looked at each solution from both end user and contnent manager points of view and we analysed pros and cons of each. At the workshop we have earmarked one of those system for further testing and future implementation. We asked one of out most passionate “user experience” advocates, Justin Benjamin (WDC), to look at it from the user point of view, and we are really happy that our front-runner distribution system candidate was unanimously preferred . We will do rigorous testing and ask for user input from various offices and market sectors to make the new system the best it can be. Be on the lookout for future updates. Revit templates Every Revit project starts with a Revit template. Our templates went through a complete overhaul in 2016. The light-weight firmwide template was rebuilt from scratch, and each office developed their templates based on the same foundation and then office templates were further customized to suit the needs of the local office. In the last three years changes have accumulated, and at the workshop we took a look  at a template comparison report to identify the most used and efficient workflows, as well as other deviations from the base. Autodesk recommends to rebuild the template from scratch every couple of years to account for changes in software versions. We will be rebilding the templates for Revit 2019. As part of this work we endeavor to build a “kit of parts” to be able to quickly customise the office templates based on needs identified in the last 3 years and additional user input.Please contact you DA or anyone on the content/template steering group with your comments and suggestions.",

    "content": "Dean Demko participated in the AEC Hackathon 5.0 in Oakland, California . Hackathons are intended to break participants out of normal routines and explore the feasibility of projects that can be achieved in a short timeframe using an ad-hoc team. We entered into the weekend with an insight that reflected an important issue: Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models for heat transfer in buildings can be validated using inexpensive Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Using our hackathon project to explore this insight yielded more value than we anticipated and we think you’ll find it exciting. This post describes what we learned and why it’s important. Innovation & the “Stacking” of Innovation At BuildingSP, we believe innovation is the process of taking a unique insight and translating it into real, actual value. As people and firms practice innovation, they get better at it. Insights and implementations become more refined and unique and the identification and realization of value is easier. Most importantly, innovation begets more innovation. The process of innovation is an exploration of a unique concept and that exploration creates more insights, which can then go through their own innovative process. We knew the repetitive nature of innovation and how it “stacked” going into the hackathon, but the uniqueness and importance of the secondary insight was actually shocking. What We Did The initiating insight for our hack was based on the capabilities of a small temperature sensor. The DS18B20 is a transistor-shaped, solid-state temperature sensor with three leads on it. They cost $1.50 each and each sensor is encoded with a unique 64-bit identifier. The DS18B20 uses a data architecture where a very large number of sensors can be connected to the same wire for data transfer. When connected to a data connection device, like a Raspberry Pi, three wires and a bunch of sensors can collect a huge amount of temperature data. How can the capabilities of the DS18B20 be used in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry? The DS18B20 “one wire bus” temperature sensor is an inexpensive device individually encoded with a unique identifier. This enables large numbers of these sensors to be connected in parallel with just three common wires. The AEC industry uses computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models to describe heat transfer in buildings. Understanding heat transfer is important because heating and cooling buildings is a significant operational cost, environmental impact, and requirement for occupant comfort. The combination of heating loads, equipment performance, operational schedules, and other variables changes the interior environment inside buildings. But based on our experience, we knew that CFD models were rarely validated or verified. How accurate are the pretty pictures we create with CFD analysis? Our hackathon room model, showing a space heater and a window, along with proposed sensor positions to validate the CFD model from Butterfly. Our hack this weekend was to prove we could use large numbers of DS18B20s and a Raspberry Pi computer to inexpensively collect lots of temperature data and compare it to CFD models. We used a ten-foot aluminum channel and added 30 DS18B20s at 4-inch increments, connected to a Raspberry Pi running code that output data files of temperature data. Dean Demko, Tyler Davis, and Jake Olsen worked on fabricating our team’s data collection “stick.” Ken Takahashi focused on code and circuitry for the Raspberry Pi while Neerav Mehta used his programming skills to format, move, and interpolate the data. Finally, Stefan Gracik used his CFD analysis skills to create a CFD model of a room at the hackathon. Neerav Mehta with Indoor Intelligence, working on code while Dean Demko figures out wire colors. What was the result? Well, everything mostly worked. We were able to collect data, the data matched the CFD model with an acceptable level of error, and the data collection method was scalable. Based on the experience, we came to the following conclusions: 1.    CFD analysis is time consuming. Stefan spent all weekend modeling a single room using the popular CFD program Butterfly. That’s a lot of time for one room. The Butterfly script for our weekend’s CFD analysis. 2.    CFD models only get more complex with more variables. In the room, we modeled a single space heater and the windows on one wall. This is not a large number of variables and doesn’t reflect actual usage of a room. More variables would dramatically increase the complexity of the model. 3.    CFD approaches don’t scale. Professor Martin Fischer from Stanford shared his own experience with CFD models. Prof. Fischer’s students used CFD to model the atrium of The Jerry Yang and Akiko Yamazaki Environment and Energy Building. The result? They were able to predict atrium temperature to within 1 degree Fahrenheit. The problem? The analysis was only possible if you had a PhD from Stanford University. The technology did not scale. An isometric of our hack’s CFD model, created by Stefan Gracik of Integral Group, using Butterfly. Stacking of Innovation What new insights did we find out during our hackathon experience? Our initial insight that started our project was that we could use cheap sensors to validate CFD models. We got that to work. But we realized that simply validating CFD models wasn’t good enough because the CFD process of analysis is very broken. But our work at the hackathon enabled a new line of development that could potentially be very, very disruptive. Here is our new insight: Data from cheap sensors, like the DS18B20, can be used to create training data for new CFD analysis tools that use artificial intelligence and machine learning. Data is a critical enabler of AI and machine learning (ML) systems. In AEC, we suffer from the problem of “under-digitalization,” a fact pointed out very well in the productivity report produced by the McKinsey Global Institute . Our hack demonstrated how cheap technology can gather data at a very high resolution, which doesn’t exist at scale because of our lack of digital data. In AI and ML, the volume, quality, and variety of data sets has a direct impact on the performance of an AI system. If we start collecting lots of data that documents heat transfer in buildings, we can use AI engines that exist today – like Google’s Tensor Flow – to create CFD tools. AI and ML for CFD approaches analysis from a different “direction” compared to current tools. CFD in current practice involves describing the physics behind building heat transfer. This entails documenting all the physical variables, barrier conditions, heat sources, and geometric situations so formulas can be used to solve large groups of concurrent differential equations. AI largely ignores physics. Instead, it looks at patterns and pattern matching to describe what is happening in the physical environment, then extends those patterns to other, similar situations. Self-learning algorithms replace differential equations that describe physical relationships. Why Is All This Important? CFD analysis for buildings is broken in current practice. But we need to increase our understanding of how buildings operate. AI can be used to revolutionize CFD analysis in the AEC industry and allow us to increase how often we use CFD, increase the number of variables and complexity of CFD models, and make CFD an everyday part of how we analyze buildings. Disruption occurs when technology causes business models to change in an industry. AI and ML applied to CFD will revolutionize our understanding of building operations by lowering barriers to current, state-of-the-art analysis.

Project Collaboration and the Digital Reality – A look at the legal aspects of BIM from PW Digital Practice on Vimeo . Password: DA Questions to Frequently Ask clients Example questions to discuss with a client regarding BIM understanding and expectations. Note: if the client has multiple internal clients like administration, facilities, and teaching/medical such as higher education, healthcare, or similar, these questions should be asked of each of the client’s internal clients and any inconsistencies reconciled. 1.      Do you expect to operate your facilities with data which could be derived from the project’s design and construction process? 2.      Do you expect the design and contractor Revit models to be set up for that purpose? 3.      What type of digital information do you currently use to manage your facilities? 4.      What current software system do you use to manage the facility? 5.      Do you manage your people, FFE or space allocation in any digital system currently? 6.      Do you have someone in your organization that could tell us the exact data format/structure of how building information gets into your existing system? (if applicable from answers above) 7.      Do you expect the contractor to create a BIM? 8.      Do you expect COBie information as a final deliverable?   If so, do you expect that information to come from the contractor?   Are there detailed guidelines as to what and how you expect to receive this information? 9.      Do you expect us to give our BIM (i.e. a Revit model) to the contractor?   If so, do their contracts and fees line up with ours to facilitate this type of workflow? 10.  Do you or the contractor have an expectation that the modeled information will be used for quantity take-offs for construction cost estimates or for advanced clash detection methods for constructability means and methods?   If so, does the project budget or our fee support the cost for those extra BIM efforts? 11.  Do you expect VR as a medium to review design progress and decisions?  If so, does the project budget support the cost of that effort? 12.  What are you and your contractor’s expectations for the use of BIM on this project?  If so, what are they?  When can we engage our respective digital practice staff to work out the details and fees?",

    "content": "Producing high-quality visualization just got easier at Perkins+Will. Starting this month Digital Practice and IT will roll out new tools, technology, machines and management software to maximize rendering potential. The aim is to provide access to all Perkins+Will designers, simplify the workflows and reduce the labor and skill needed to deliver quality renderings. New Tools – First, look for the award-winning V-Ray render engine to appear within Revit, Rhino, SketchUp, and 3ds Max. This means designers can remain in their 3D application of choice potentially avoiding the recurring labor and special skills required to transfer model geometry between applications. Less time spent mastering technology means more time for design and more designers able to produce visualization. New Machines – Adding further convenience and productivity for designers High Performance Computing (HPC) render farms will be accessible from all of the previously mention applications. The computational power of these new render farms gives designers far more rendering speed than the most powerful laptops or workstations alone. Designers using computational nodes can also render to the HPC render farms without disturbing other designers with whom they share a node. New Technology – Swarm is the newest development in renderings technology. It is an advanced type of distributed bucket rendering (DBR) allowing designers’ to see the active rendering live on their desktops while rendering to the HPC render farms. This eliminates the time wasted waiting to see the final image after sending the job away to a render farm. Designers can now use the HPC render farm for progress renderings comprising the vast majority of all rendering activity. Reducing the time to produce progress renderings is the biggest opportunity to lower the overall turnaround time for visualization projects. New Management Software – Maximizing designers use of the HPC render farms is a suite of applications called Deadline. Within this suite designers only need to use Deadline Monitor . It will act as both a gateway and queueing system for renderings ensuring the designers can squeeze the most out of the rendering farms. Monitor shows designers which machines are available, lists current and past rendering activity, identifies other designers’ jobs and allows new jobs submissions to the render farm. On-the-Job Learning – Respecting the need of designers to stay focused on their projects, Digital Practice has created a series of easy to follow microKnowlege cards . Using these cards designers can quickly see the steps needed to begin using these new visualization assets from the 3D application of their choice. Throughout the month of March these new assets will become visible on laptops and workstations used for visualization as well as computational nodes. The Swarm technology has not yet found its way into 3ds Max. However, other exclusive features are available for 3ds Max to render to the HPC render farms. These new visualization assets offer opportunities and new possibilities not just for designers already creating visualization for the firm, but for any designers wanting to create compelling visualization. Your Digital Practice team enjoys hearing back from you. So please let us know how these new visualization resources are improving your work life and projects. During 2018, we will continue our visualization efforts so watch for future announcements in the Digital Practice ReCap.",

    "content": "Have you ever been in a VR experience, and tried to grab an object with your hands? Grabbing objects with one’s hand is the most natural gesture that human has been using since birth to explore and learn about the world around them. Being able to touch an object, hold it, move it or throw it, these actions all help us form a better understanding of our surrounding and confirm the reality that we are in. The holy grail of designing a perfect VR experience is to create an experience so real that a person’s body instinctively react as if it’s in the real world. In order to accomplish that, the combined effect delivered to a person’s different senses must all be synchronized to create that full immersive experience. Currently the sight, sound and movement are coordinated via the VR headset, VR controllers and 3D surround sound. To add the touch sensation into the mix, one need to rethink how haptic experience can be delivered in the most simple and natural way. Haptics is the science of applying touch (tactile) sensation and control to interaction with computer applications. The earliest attempt of delivering haptics is through vibration. Just like the smartphones, controllers can be programmed to vibrate whenever they touch a virtual object in VR. Using that vibration as a tactile feedback, the person holding the controller can then physically senses the moment of contact with an object in the virtual world. To take it one step further, several companies have designed different VR gloves that are even more natural than a controller in delivering that haptic sensation in VR. We will take a closer look at the gloves by Bend Lab and HaptX, and imagine how we as designers can potentially benefit from using these new interface. Bend Lab Based in Salt Lake City and Seattle, Bend Lab has developed a VR glove that uses a proprietary rubber material that is embedded with nano- scale sensors. Using these sensors, the glove can accurately track the movement of your hand and fingers, then use that data to simulate a highly responsive virtual hand in VR, thus giving the user a hyper-realistic sensation of using one’s hand to manipulate objects in the virtual world. Though it lack any tactile feedback, the speed and sensitivity of the simulated hands was enough to fool your brain into interacting naturally with the virtual objects. Their demo application offered activities such as building LEGO like blocks, finger painting, and even juggling! I had the chance to try out these gloves at an Expo in San Francisco. It took me all of 2 seconds to forget that I was in VR, and started exploring the virtual world using my hands. Since there are no buttons on the gloves, the program offered on screen menu, which I could use my finger to touch and choose the options that I wanted. Using the gloves felt so much more natural than using a pair of controllers to manipulate the blocks. I didn’t need any training or instruction on which buttons to click. It was an absolute delight to explore VR in the most natural way I instinctively know, just by using my hands as I would have done so in the real world! After testing their finger painting program, and having a blast painting only with my fingers in VR, I was totally sold on these gloves! I can totally see the great potential of using these gloves for our designers to draw and sketch in the most natural way. HaptX HaptX is a startup company that has designed a true haptic glove. The HaptX glove is covered with a grid of mini air bubbles that can be inflated and defalted to create a pressure sensation onto the area where the virtual object touches your hand. The glove is built with such high density grid of pressure bubbles that you can even feel the sensation of a little spider walking on your palm! Along with the air bubbles are resistance bands on the back of your fingers that help create the force feedback sesnsation when you try to grab an object. Without the force feedback, you only feel the pressure on your finger tips, and your hand can still move right though a solid object. But combine the air bubble pressure with the force feedback, your hand stops at the object when the force feedback pulls your fingers back, the resulting sensation of grabbing a solid object in VR becomes absolutely mind blowing. How can we as designers make use of this technology? We can immediately see a few use cases that could potentially be quite useful. One is for urban design master planning, where designers can use the glove while in VR, to plan and manipulate the building blocks, and get instant design feedback in VR. Another use case would be a friendlier user interface for testing virtual mock up. For example, when testing a surgical room design, the client could wear the VR gloves to test the layout of the equipment and move the equipment with their hands. Using their gloved hands to test the useability of the room and equipment layout in VR would be much more natural than having to use the controllers. Currently, several Perkins + Will offices have already started with the process of testing these haptics gloves, we hope to have a follow up article soon with more in-depth feedback on the result of our exploration into Haptics!

    "content": "This month we would like to focus on tools created for Revit  by PW talent, You are probably very familiar with Revit plugins  that you can find on Perkins+Will tab of Revit, they have been in production for a long time. Most of these tools were created by Iffat Mai in collaboration with many DAs as subject matter experts If you never used them, please explore! But there are  many tasks that can be automated using other, more developer friendly  tool – Dynamo. Last year Digital Practice has trained many people in Dynamo, and this training yielded a crop of new tool makers. Here are some of their stories – challenges and tools Minneapolis – EquipThis_v2.0 (Dynamo) In the Minneapolis Studio our Interior team wanted a tool that would rapidly build place-holder families from client supplied excel files. One aspect of the tool that makes it so powerful was a requirement that the tool could be used on Excel documents regardless of format. “Not every equipment list is alike” they said. The EquipThis tool was designed to read excel documents, regardless of format, and create multiple families with the given data. The only requirments are that the user tells EquipThis which Cells, Columns, and Unit format to consider when parsing the excel document. We also included the ability to map 3 additional parameters if desired. Some uses have been to include Manufacturer or Model information within the family for later scheduling or sorting. The user also needs to specify a family. We intentionally used tthe Firmwide PW_SuperGenericEquipment family as it is used by many of the offices for this purpose and we wanted to retain much of the existing workflows, parameters, and familiarity. Our team did make some minor edits so that it is clean when loaded and if you are interested you can find the Minneapolis copy here: https://S :\\Minneapolis\\_Revit Resources_MIN\\Revit Content\\Specialty Equipment     (from Explorer)The tool is able to rapidly generate hundreds of families in a matter of minutes or seconds. The team claims to have saved DAYS of work since this tool was released. If you are interested in saving your team a boat load of time, take this baby for a spin! https://S :\\Minneapolis\\Dynamo\\Development     (From Explorer) Creator – Adam Hamilton DA MIN Create Sheets for Design Options (Dynamo) It’s a very time consuming process for teams to build similar sheet layouts for multiple design options in Revit.  Since it’s important to have things named properly, aligned consistently, etc. it was a perfect candidate for dynamo scripting. Workflow/Logic Diagram Example Design Options Box Dynamo Pop-Up The tool is very simple in it’s implementation.  The script assumes you have at least one design option set created with design options in them.  It will do the following:​Duplicate the sheet, with it’s views, to new sheets, in the same location.Automatically name the new views and sheetsCopy Legends if desiredAssign the views to their associated design option.Note: There is a current limitation which prevents elevation and section views from getting the design option assigned.  Another limitation prevents this working with “Area Plan” type of views.Upon launching Dynamo or Dynamo Player and the script, you get the dialog box to the left.  There are 3 Selections: Which Sheets do you want to duplicate? Which Design Option Set do you want to duplicate for?  The tool will automatically duplicate as many times as there are options within the set. Do you want any legends on the sheet(s) to be duplicated as well?After making your selections, the script will run and create duplicate sheets and associated views, properly named with the same locations as the input sheets. Example Starting Point and Resulting Sheets The script can be located here: “S:\\Dallas\\Revit – Texas Office Families and Details\\Dynamo\\Dynamo Player Ready\\Sheets – Create for Design Options.dyn” Be sure to map your packages as you will need Datashapes, Clockwork, Springs, and SteamNodes.

    "content": "This past month the AIA and the Design Futures Council hosted separate but somewhat similar conferences on emerging technologies which are suited to change how we design and run our business. Both events were well attended and helped to spark conversation among the participants. Each had presenters from within and outside our industry speak to advances in Artificial Intelligence & Machine learning and some potential risks in how we must protect not only our data, but also our client’s data. I learned from listening and speaking with other firms that no one entity has created a fully autonomous design solution by enabling Artificial Intelligence algorithms. There is no simple solution and at this point no large software developer is solely focused on architectural design.  However, there are many  who are focusing upstream in the construction and manufacturing industry. This year will be very interesting as internal projects at Perkins+Will begin to introduce components of AI and ML, working with outside consultants and possibly other firms to advance the design process. My take away from both events is that Perkins+Will is leading the charge in how AI & ML will have an influence on the design process. I have included a recap to the Design Futures Event below which is an excellent review of the presentations.  I particularly enjoyed the presentation by Ana Pinto Da Silva , the Principal UX Design Lead at Amazon.",

    "content": "In Perkins+Will we are striving to use commercially available tools to our full advantage and we create custom tools when commercial tools fall short. Today I’d like to focus on the tools we already own which many of you are familiar with and use quite frequently but may not have used to your full advantage yet. We hope these very simple and  practical tips will save you time and make your project processes easier. ViewAQC formerly known as DRU This Revit Add-on solves the problem of referencing views contained on the sheets in different Revit models. It was initially piloted by Digital Practice in collaboration with the Swedish First Hill project team, and now is also succesfully used on projects in the Los Angeles and Miami offices. The teams feedback is very positive and teams which worked with it want to use it on other large projects, so we would like to remind the large project teams about this productivity tool.  Here is a link for more details . Also, there was a live webinar on February 1 which was recorded and you can watch. Password is “DA” Revit Express Tool:  Import and Link manager This is a huge time saver which does what it states really well. find  and delete unneeded DWG imports and  links- both 3D and 2D. quickly check and change Reference type and Workset of  Revit links and 3D CAD links easily export all link information to excel for tracking changes select all links and pin them , so they will not be moved accidentally – my personal favorite As with any CTC tools link to the videos is in the tool interface Revit Express Tool:  Spreadsheet Link Almost all of you are familiar with this productivity enhancer. But did you know that it can work with properties  and parameters that are not possible to schedule natively in Revit? For example, you can quickly check whether or not you have dependend views and whether or not they are on the sheets.(Reminder- primary view should never be on the sheet) Revit Express Tool:  BIMList Browser By now there is not a Revit user in Perkins+Will who is not using it. here is a link to previous posting with many tips. One more tip: Many users prefer to keep it in the tree mode and s how current project content as well. (current project content is not searchable in BIMList and there are no previews). Note that library families that have been already loaded in the project are highlighted in the library. In addition, we have created a Cross Database Search dashboard which allows you to search all databases at once If you are new and need an overview of our content ecosystem here is a link to previous  post Also there are helpful MK cards, here is the latest External healthcare content source: SEPS2BIM Content from outside sources in general is spotty in quality and using it without cleanup can adversely affect your project. However  we would like to remind you about one specific source that we can recommend for consistent quality Healthcare content. https://seps2bim.org/bimobject.html . This content was created and is maintained by DOD and VA, and it is highly searchable and free to use. You can log in with your ADSK account, or create an independent account. Revit 2018 Improvements There are many improvements that Autodesk implemented with new version of Revit. We talked about many of them  in previous newsletters here , and here , but there is one tiny interface improvement that makes me happy every day and in every project I open in 2018. Right click Menu in Project Browser has a Collapse All option. No more annoying scrolling! In the next newletter we will focus on tools created by P+W – stay tuned",

    "content": "On December 7-8, I was honored to be invited as a panelist for the AEC VR panel at the VRX conference hosted by VR Intelligence. VRX is a two-day conference in San Francisco that focus on the business of VR and immersive technology. As a B2B event, the sessions at the event were focused on providing in-depth discussions of how different industry or enterprises have been using VR and AR in their business. With over 80 speakers, VRX has gathered many senior level leaders of VR from a wide range of industries such as gaming, film, broadcasting, automitive, engineering, architecture, healthcare, retail, tourism, hopistality, marketing and more. Our AEC focused session was titled “How VR and immersive tech are changing the face of architecture and AEC”. We had four panelists, all VR leaders from our respective firms including Gensler, AECOM, Perkins&Will, and Room Scale Labs. The session was moderated by Nathan Gaydhani of Cityscape Digital. After comparing notes with the other large firms, it is clear that VR has been actively used for project pursuit with positive results for most large firms. We are also seeing VR being integrated as part of the design review process, and AR being used during construction coordination and visualization phases.",

It is our goal to empower you to continue Perkins+Will’s tradition of design innovation by elevating the firm’s access to digital technology. The benefits of planning efforts in 2017 are set to pay off early in 2018.  There are 3 distinct areas, 2 hardware and 1 software. Modeling Laptops CPU Clusters Rendering Engines Working closely with Design teams across the firm, a new “Modeling” Laptop has been spec’d as an alternative to the Yoga. Tested to handle the latest applications, these laptops are capable of delivering advanced modeling, visualization and simulations to our clients. Late last month these laptops began shipping and will continue to roll out through the first quarter. The infrastructure team has been readying CPU Clusters . These clusters are committed to CPU intensive tasks, like traditional renderings and animations. Maximizing the power of these compute clusters is a new resource management software. This software optimizes the clusters by broadening access to their power with over 80 content creation applications including computational design tasks, video editing and compositing applications. The platform is also expandable for future uses not yet imagined. The CPU clusters will be available soon in a handful of offices, with the majority available by the end of Q1. With these new hardware solutions available, we can now commit to providing best-in-class rendering engines and emerging visualization applications to our designers. This is why Vray for Max, Rhino, Sketchup and [soon] Revit will be available as a firm wide resource. We have also penned agreements with Enscape and Lumion to provide firmwide licensing. Vray,  Enscape and Lumion licensing have been rolled out and are now available. Fueling fast, powerful, and more agile methods of design exploration, these High Performance Computing resources will further enable Perkins+Will’s strong culture of design innovation.",

Known as VX—short for “Virtual Experience”—the app is a digital passport to places like an early 20th century high school building in Dallas, Texas that’s been transformed into a modern-day architecture studio (one of Perkins+Will’s 24 studios worldwide, in fact), or an 11-story tower annex and renovation project in Lubbock, Texas that houses City Hall and other public agencies and services. The app also reveals project specifications and other design details to allow for a more informative digital tour of the spaces. “VX is another tool in our growing kit of digital experience technologies that ultimately helps our clients immerse themselves in the design process and be part of the design journey with us,” says Nick Cameron , Perkins+Will’s director of digital practice. “Our goal is to continuously innovate so that we deliver an ever-richer, ever-more compelling experience for our clients.” VX can be downloaded for free in Apple’s App Store , but requires iOS 9 or later. The app can be used with or without a VR headset, though a headset is recommended for a more immersive experience.",

Not pictured, Thomas Jacobs Team Otter, seven architects and programmers, including Ted Hogan and Luc Deckinga of Perkins+Will, won first place in the Autodesk Forge development challenge and second place in the overall software challenge category at the Builtworlds 2017 Hackathon in Chicago, December 1-3. The event took place over two days at MHub, a co-working and fabrication space. Teams were formed on Friday evening, and work progressed all day Saturday, finishing Sunday morning for presentation to the judges and other participants that afternoon. Team Otter was composed of four professional programmers with little exposure to the AEC industry teaming up with Luc and Ted of Perkins+Will and Thomas Trinelle, an Application Engineer at Flux.io. The team built Ottereview, a web application to assist in the architectural drawing review process. Using Autodesk’s Forge platform the team was able to extract information from two sequential versions of a Revit model and create displays and reports showing only the sheets and elements that changed from one to the next.  Using this tool would hopefully result in a better and faster review. By highlighting exactly what the reviewer should focus on they are less likely to miss a crucial change, resulting in greater headaches down the road as the project moves into construction. Using this system over the life of a project, tracking what was added, changed or deleted at every step, would give you a histogram of the design process. Autodesk, who sponsored the event along with Flux.io, had several members of the Forge Platform development team on hand who were indispensable in answering questions and providing code examples to build from. 5 minute highlight video: https://builtworlds.com/videos/2017-builtworlds-hackathon-champions-innovation-collaboration/ click to enlarge",

    "content": "We at Perkins+Will are proud of our highly collaborative culture. It encompasses all aspects of our work. The tools we use are a combination of commercial software, ie Rhino,  Revit, Bluebeam, third party add-ons, and solutions developed in-house. Digital Practice in collaboration with firm wide experts constantly work on improving our tools, implementing new technologies and processes. Your local DA and other local experts are your first resource and can point you in the right direction. Following is  a quick overview of other resources you may use to find the best tool for the job, use it in the best possible way, and  collaborate in process improvement. How do I? For  some time now, Digital Practice have been accumulating collective wisdom of Design Application Managers and other firmwide experts and publishing it at Perkins+ Will Microknowledge site https://mk.perkinswill.com/ . If you are looking for information about the best way to do something, this is the place to start.  You can always get there from OKTA. Latest and greatest in P+W visualization, VR/AR The AR/VR field develops very fast and the teams use a variety of different tools. Case studies of P+W visualisation tools can be found in previous editions of this newsletter. P+W have regular visualiation calls where teams present and discuss different VR/AR solutions and share experiences. This effort is coordinated by Iffat Mai (Digital Practice Manager) who is working with  Design Applications managers and teams from all offices. 2017: The year of Dynamo for Computational Design This year more than 70 designers completed intensive 2-day workshops, given in 5 Perkins+Will offices, where they learned how to use Dynamo to automate Revit tasks and set up parametric systems for design exploration. Attendees have put their new talents to good use, creating over 150 scripts now available for Dynamo Player, an interface that enables non-Dynamo users to execute scripts written by others. The Dynamo Player script library folder is S:\\_Firmwide\\Dynamo\\DynamoPlayerScripts\\ with subfolders for each office. See the following microKnowledge cards for step-by-step instructions for accessing Dynamo Player, the script library and additional plugins, called ‘packages’. How do I access the Dynamo Player script library? How do I access the P+W Dynamo packages? More training is in the works for 2018. If you are interested in learning more about Dynamo, contributing to the script library or scheduling training in your office, contact your Design Application Manager or reach out to P+W’s computational design leader, Luc Deckinga . Hackstack There is always room for improvement – and if you have an idea of creating a tool that can help you with your design process, please share it here: https://dp.perkinswill.com/hackstack/ . After submitting a tool suggestion, please join our monthly HackStack Tools call where we can discuss your submission in further details. Clarity It is hard to believe that is is just over a year since Clarity was implemented firmwide. The effort was spearheaded by Matt Petermann (Digital Practice Manager). This automation tool is heavily used in all PW offices because it automates a lot of time-consuming and tedious tasks on the projects. If your project does not use it for print/export automation, please talk to your DA! in addition to  simple tasks, it can also help with project analytics, comparisons and many other tasks. What’s new in Revit 2018 Revit 2018 has been rolled out firmwide . There are several noteworthy improvements in Revit 2018  functionality which will make your life a bit easier:My favorites so far are: Expand/collapse the Project Browser with right-click commands Browser organization for schedules Dynamo Player supports input for scripts. With more and more people learning Dynamo, we can take advantage of rapid development You can now schedule model groups and RVT links You can now add parameters to model groups, RVT links, and schedules Improvements to Railings Improvements to Multistory stairs for more information and videos : https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2018/ENU/?guid=GUID-C81929D7-02CB-4BF7-A637-9B98EC9EB38B What’s new in your Revit Ribbon If you had not used CTC tools before, please explore – there are many productivity tools in Revit Express Tools tab. Perkins+Will tab got a facelift and an improved Copy Legend tool pyRevit tab contains two new tools  – to create sheet set based on revision number, and to make pattern from detail lines Add-Ins tab has a Metamorfosis tool – to create snapshots in time and compare with previous version of the model. This is a standalone version of what can be done using Clarity. JOTools tab allows you to mass save and mass load families  and transfer single project standard item from another project,",

    "content": "For the past year and a half our Atlanta healthcare team has been working on many projects for the Northeast Georgia Health System, including developing ambulatory clinic standards, interior design standards, and renovations across multiple campuses. This growing healthcare system approached Perkins+Will with these standardization projects because of our expertise in Lean processes and design with the goal that the standards would be used for new construction, such as the multi-specialty clinic in Buford, Georgia, as well as retrofitting existing clinics throughout the system. As part of the clinic module development process for the Buford project, we challenged some of the planning assumptions that had been incorporated into the client’s previous projects to make sure that the new standard would function as desired, be flexible for future reconfiguration, and be the best use of space and resources within challenging budgets. To do so, we spent several meetings reviewing many different diagrams and assessments of floor plan layouts, but the client did not seem to be fully convinced because it was difficult to visualize a critical feature: how the staff could simultaneously have a private-enough workspace to discourage interruptions by patients without completely separating them from the patients as they entered and exited the exam rooms. In one of the final workshops, we decided to model several example configurations and used virtual reality to demonstrate the sight lines and travel distances associated with the options. We brought the HTC Vive VR headset with us to our workshop and let the client experience the space as we presented the design options. Since only one person at a time is able to use the VR headset, we projected the VR presentation onto a wall outside the conference room and shared the VR experience with the rest of the client group. The ability to see the various configurations to scale as if they were really standing in the space helped the group to make a quick and certain decision on the module configuration – a true “aha!” moment. Later on, our primary client contact told us that he was impressed with our use of virtual reality because they had previously spent over $80,000 on a cardboard city, which hadn’t been as successful for them, and had been so labor-intensive and difficult to change and explore multiple options. After this workshop, the Cardiology group reached out to us to renovate a cardiology clinic on one of the hospital campuses. They had really liked our clinic module and the design process using VR. As we progressed with the design for that project, we brought the VR back for an interior design presentation. For this round, we used the Oculus system with Enscape to show more detail in the lighting and materials for the space. The client again took turns using the VR headset or watched on the computer screen if they didn’t feel comfortable putting on a headset. The client connected with the design and reacted well with the more developed and rendered model. A side benefit of using Enscape while developing the interior design was the interior design team being able to make better decisions very quickly about the scale of certain elements in the space that are not as apparent in static views. After trying out both the Vive and Oculus systems, our team does prefer the easier setup and smaller components of the Oculus system. Both systems have worked well for us and the client. Even when the clients were experiencing virtual reality for the first time, most of them were willing to try on the headset. They were easily able to navigate through the space (with assistance from the design team members standing beside them). Many clients have difficulty visualizing space the way we do, and by immersing the client in the VR model, we are able to overcome this challenge and accelerate design decisions being made. This was especially true when the NGHS group could walk around and verify that they could see all the exam room doors from the team station! We forsee making realtime tools such as Enscape and the virtual reality client experience a permanent part of our design process. It has already proven that it can speed up the design process for both the client and our internal design team without spending hours to render static views or spend thousands of dollars on cardboard mock-ups.

This year Perkins+Will was well represented by almost each practice and office.The theme for this years conference was “The Future of Making Things”, the same as 2016, which may be telling in and of itself. The buzzwords pushed this year and woven into every keynote were AI, Generative Design, and Machine Learning while VR took a backseat. This makes sense as VR and real-time rendering are being embraced in our daily process, hopefully we see this trend with AI in the coming years. The Autodesk Forge platform was also heavily promoted. Forge is the platform many have their hopes pinned on for delivering the next generation of design software, Forge promises to deliver interoperability between apps and data unlike anything currently on the market. We will keep you posted on where this and other emerging tech is going throughout the year. As a team we hosted several social events to meet one another face to face and share what we were seeing & hearing. We also held 5 sessions both live and streaming to over 1,000 conference attendees, once again cementing our firm as a leader in applied design technology. Here is a link to an overview and class materials for each session: Selecting and Integrating the Right VR/AR Workflows for Client Engagement Michael Weiser-Ward and Vina Aboshira jointly presented a wonderful session on VR/AR workflow session. A New Design Paradigm in Mixed Reality using HoloLens for Architectural Design Michael Shyu along with Fei Xie, Chance Heath and Iffat Mai co-presented a session focused on their research for the “Augmented Design” Innovation Incubator project. You Can’t Manage What You Don’t Measure Nick Cameron and Dan Chasteen presented a case study of how the Digital Practice Group at Perkins+Will is able to utilize modeling data in near realtime to measure the performance of the design process. Join the Party in Social VR Iffat Mai and Simon Chavez shared the process on how to setup a shared VR experience for multiple users to simultaneously be in the virtual environment together. Up the Ante Josh Moore and Justin Benjamin teamed up for the second year in a row to focus on core Revit skills and opportunities to increase the reliability of Revit models with better modeling habits. Please reach out to the folks whom attended from your office for additional insight and we will keep you posted on where new and emerging tech is going throughout the year.",

Their presentation focused on their research for the “ Augmented Design” Innovation Incubator project. The team consisted of Michael Shyu (PW Boston), Fei Xie (PW Boston), Chance Heath (PW Dallas) and Iffat Mai (PW New York). The team demonstrated how Mixed reality (MR) combines virtual and physical realities into one space which offers an exciting new design opportunity for architects. By projecting the BIM model directly over the physical site in MR, architects can communicate design ideas to the team and clients in an immersive and interactive way. The session demonstrated the Innovation Incubators MR case studies, using Microsoft HoloLens, applied for different phases of architectural projects. We shared our exploration regarding the process of precision alignment of a BIM model with the physical project site, how to use MR for full scale virtual mockups of design options and small scale models, as well as examining the potential of MR tools for construction administration with our vision of an on-site MR clash detection and documentation.” Click HERE for more details on the Presentation and session handout.

The topic was a case study of how the Digital Practice Group at Perkins+Will is able to utilize BIM data in near realtime to measure the performance of the design process, delivering proactive guidance to design teams and offering insight to the business operations. During the presentation, Nick and Dan demonstrated how Digital Practice wrangles data from across all of Perkins+Will’s offices amounting to more than 700 active projects and 1,000-plus designers daily. The advantages of gathering this data was validated in a live demonstration of Model Reporter, a dashboard application developed in house by Digital Practice. Questions following the presentation lasted more the 20 minutes. At one point Luc Deckinga assisted with answering some of the audience’s questions. After the formal dismisal of the presentation the large majority of the audience remained seated to ask more questions. One audience member stated the presentation was the capstone of his Autodesk University conference.",

It was a quick timetable with lots of bureaucracy, It also was done with a 50/50 associate architect.  After a brief conversation with the Project Architect who is also our Technical Director in the office, he wanted to comment on the game-changing technologies that we utilized on this project that enabled it to be any success at all. Highlighted below are some of those technologies which are available to everyone across the firm. 1. Bluebeam – a.          For UM review comments and internal document markups. HSEC was the first project for University to test Bluebeam Studio for University review/comments and design team response/feedback b.       Reference drawing hot links.  This project affected seven different buildings in addition to the new building.  We created a site plan showing all affected buildings with hot links (hyperlinks) to immediately send team members to any building’s original CDs and subsequent renovation CDs. c.       Photo Keys: Similar to the item above we created floor plans with arrows to hotlink team members to field verification/survey photographs. 2. One Note – simple organization for shared information and ability to simultaneously take and embellish notes/lists/etc. a.       Creating agendas for an upcoming consultant, owner, and internal meetings – entire team could simply add to agenda when thoughts came into their mindsb.       Meeting minutes – quick note taking during meetings and rapid distribution (have one or more person “assigned” to take notes during meetings, the ability to immediately share these down and dirty notes immediately afterward – or use/modify them for “official” meeting minutes)c.       Task lists: Multiple task lists for team members/project phases/field verifications needed, etc. d. Addendum narrative: it worked great to allow the entire Perkins+Will team to edit write-up simultaneously, then paste final write-up into Word for addendum issuance. No more having one Word file for narrative and 6 additional “save as” copies for multiple team members documenting at the same time. (One glitch: we tried to get SLAM, our Connecticut-based partner architect involved in this but couldn’t accomplish it technically) 3. Clarity – daily (overnight) drawing sheet plots and batch plots for major drawing issuances – without tying up one team member’s time and computer 4. VR – Enscape a.       Used VR session for the design team to “walk through” and discuss design items observedb. Future: do these sessions with consultants to review overhead ductwork, etc.c.       Note: we used this new tool way late in the project CD phase.  We plan to use it as a design tool/QA tool on future projects!",

The class this year was live streamed! Click HERE to check it out! Course Description: Many designers often feel it can be difficult to create models that accurately express their design intent, often trying to “beat Revit into submission”. This often leads to poor modeling habits and in some cases, a complete lack of necessary modeled geometry, causing coordination issues. In this course, we will discuss common challenges encountered when modeling various types of building elements, and discuss some tips & tricks for overcoming them. We will find some solutions are “hidden” right within Revit, and others may be solved with creative modeling “hacks” and techniques. We will discuss modeling tips that overcome common challenges related to curtain wall and stairs/railings as well as discuss families/content created that enable special workflows related code compliance, site plans, and hybrid detailing. All of these techniques, can contribute to increased model reliability, better coordinated designs, and overall increased efficiency and project profits. Learning Objectives: ·         Identify some of the most common modeling challenges that occur on design projects and ways to overcome them ·         Identify the pros and cons of various modeling and documentation workflows ·         Discover specific processes and family creation techniques that enable more coordinated workflows ·         Increase the value and reliability of their company’s BIM Models Josh and Justin got a ton of positive comments and feedback and both look forward to more opportunities to present at technology conferences.

    "content": "The Viz Lab and Digital Practice has launched an early prototype of an augmented reality (AR) app that will eventually allow designers to engage with their models in a hybrid real-world/virtual environment. The app, known as AX—short for “Augmented Experience”—is currently in beta: it allows users to become familiar with its interface by exploring Perkins+Will-designed spaces in a 3D, augmented reality setting. Imagine, for example, seeing scaled models of the Shanghai Natural History Museum or the River Beech Tower right in your own living room, office, or neighborhood—and then being able to share those scenarios on social media. In subsequent beta versions of AX, users will be able to engage with even more building models and experiment with tools that alter those buildings’ design characteristics, like massing, glazing, and fenestration. Perkins+Will Augmented Reality App “AX” Demo from Perkins+Will “We wanted to explore the potential of this new technology and have some fun in the process,” says Nick Cameron, Perkins+Will’s digital practice director. “We couldn’t wait to tap into the current excitement swirling around AR, so this initial release only scratches the surface of what is possible.” Ultimately, AX will be refined so that it can be used both in the design process and by developers who want to interact with and see the impacts of certain design decisions to better understand their value. The goal is to positively transform how clients and designers can collaborate during the project-delivery process. AX takes advantage of the augmented reality features in Apple’s latest operating system and is free through the App Store. It’s available to users with an AR-capable iPad or iPhone running iOS 11. Navigation within the app is easy, and no headgear or architectural training required. Download the app from the App Store.",

    "content": "I got an email from my friend Saeran at Kieran Timberlake a week or so ago, asking if I were attending the annual Thornton Tomasetti-hosted AEC hackathon in New York. I hadn’t been considering it (I’d forgotten), but it seemed like it might be fun: get together with peers from around the country for a weekend to solve industry-specific problems, building a real, working product in under 30 hours. Saeran was on my team last year when we won with BEnMap . I bought my $50 ticket–not a bad price for a weekend’s worth of entertainment and learning. I met Saeran, Petr, and Mark at a Thai place on Friday night before the hackathon started. I was late; they’d already finished their food and a round of beer and were deep into a conversation very familiar to tech-leaning engineers and architects: industry complaints about inefficiency, the sorry state of programming practice and knowledge, the prevalence of pseudo-science and overapplication of buzzy terminology: Big data. Machine learning. Agile-this-and-that. And so on. On any other night, these might have been idle complaints, but starting early the next morning we would be gathering to do the opposite of just talk: we were going to try to make something real. Saeran I knew, the others were new to me. I thought it an appropriate introduction to rant about “machine learning.” I should state clearly that I am not experienced with ML–I’ve messed around with some stats programs and completed tutorials on artificial neural networks, I’ve gotten TensorFlow to recognize STOP signs about as well as a dog might–so I didn’t have much to say about the technology itself. Clearly some people have done some incredible things with it. I am experienced, however, with the problem of empty talk in our field, and I know how often “Machine Learning”-butter gets spread on a problem to make it more palatable, without any understanding of whether or not its use is appropriate or even possible. I was willing to bet someone would be proposing something with ML. I made my skepticism clear. The next morning we met bright and early in the shiny new Cornell campus on Roosevelt Island–so new I personally got to christen a bathroom. The views of Midtown and Long Island City were absolutely incredible. When an engineer named Margaret from Thornton Tomasetti formed a group around her problem, “Can we teach a computer to recognize geometric shapes using machine learning?” I of course joined up. What went on for the next thirty hours was a reminder of why I went into architecture in the first place, and why I stay: a group of people fascinated by problems, motivated to learn real skills that allow them to find solutions, working together. Our team consisted of architects and engineers from NBBJ, Kieran Timberlake, Thornton Tomasetti, Dar, and of course Perkins+Will. When identifying pyramids, cones, spheres, and cubes proved relatively easy, the group generalized the problem and started looking at categorizing buildings using New York City’s LIDAR-generated collection of building meshes. The (minor) sleep-deprivation reminded me of studio, and the last-minute scramble with fragile demos and file permissions felt like any other deadline. My Grasshopper skills are mediocre at best, so my contributions were meager–unlike last year, I did much more learning than tutoring. I managed to keep myself useful with some straightforward distance calculations and some ray-casting based on previous experience mitigating spherical sampling bias; I also made some nice-ish diagrams. Mostly I kept out of the way of Petr the stats guy (and his imposing beard), and Marc the Grasshopper guru. At somewhere around 10pm on Saturday night we put the pieces together, fired it up, and were pleasantly surprised when eveything worked: we performed visual checks, we ran some regressions to verify what we were looking at, and all signs pointed to a successful building typology categorizer. Once the excitement of having made something died down, we got into an hours-long discussion on implications; we tried adding energy dimensions to the data, we discussed the meaning of a form-based analysis of building typologies as an addendum to zoning and land value studies. The winning project was a tool to automatically generate an HVAC solution in Revit–diffusers, VAV boxes, and a complete (sized and located) duct system. Very slick. Ours got positive mention from the ML specialist on the panel, though we didn’t place. Nobody on our team cared: we had set out to make something and we did it; it’s real and it works, and you can download the completed script, Metashape, here . The project structure is a little wonky and the Grasshopper dependencies are absolutely annoying–hey, it was thrown together in 30 hours–but with a little work you’ve got a verified Machine Learning script that can reliably categorize buildings in Lower Manhattan purely through their geometric characteristics. Is it useful? Perhaps. Will it make anyone any money? Doubtful. In a field so beholden to sales, sometimes it’s nice to just make something real.",

    "content": "Following the viewing of a Lumion video costing $6 thousand, a donation of $5 million was contributed towards the building of the new MUSC Shawn Jenkins Children’s Hospital in Charleston. The generous donation made by Charleston businesswoman Anita Zucker and her family, following the viewing of the Lumion video created in-house by Perkins+Will. According to Jim Fisher, VP of MUSC Development, the decision was made based on the excitement generated by the Lumion video. Randy Maxwell, a Senior Project Designer of Perkins+Will’s Atlanta office, teamed with Jim to develop and create the Lumion presentation video. Initially, Randy created the Lumion video for a design development presentation and used the Lumion model integrally throughout the entire design development workflow. This same Lumion model was revised to create the donor video presentation. The final video production took approximately 5 working days to create. To run Lumion, a laptop with a compatible and dedicated graphics card like Perkins+Will’s VR laptops is required. The Digital Practice team identified these laptops as a critical need early in 2017 and pushed for their availability. Many Perkins+Will offices now have these laptops as a resource to enhance the capabilities of visualization. In an interview with local NBC Channel 2 News Anita Zucker stated, Zucker said her family’s decision to support the atrium was rooted in their shared belief in the therapeutic importance of “down time” to hospitalized children. “We know that children generally have a better hospital experience when they feel safe and relaxed,” she said. “That’s why a space like this is so important. It gives them a place where they can work through their fear in a really fun way, where they can just be kids and not patients.” Lumion is an extremely intuitive visualization tool that allows designers to create and visualize places and spaces in real-time. An extensive content library of animated materials, people, vehicles, etc. as well as an intuitive interface to study and alter lighting and atmosphere, makes this a design tool of choice for Randy. The final video was post-produced in Adobe Premiere which incorporated 10 video clips from Lumion. The initial competition video that was used as part of the request for proposal submittal for the MUSC Shawn Jenkins Children’s Hospital, was outsourced at a cost of $20,000 and did not compare in quality to the Lumion donor video. The cost of the Lumion video produced for this effort compares in cost to typically more than twice the cost of still renderings. Depending on the client and the situation, there may be an opportunity to charge even more for the service. The value of being able to create this kind of visualization in-house for the client opens many opportunities for additional services and client satisfaction. In the case for MUSC, Jim Fisher has asked to team with Perkins+Will again to generate more donor videos. SJCH Child Life from PW Digital Practice on Vimeo . Password: DA",

    "content": "While there are many new features in Revit 2018 below I have narrowed them to the ones of most interest for people transitioning to the newest version of Perkins+Will’s core software.    The biggest reason to move to the newest platform is the speed and stability that they continue to work on to reduce errors and corruption in our models. Perkins+Will Addins We have simplified our internal tools to remove the redundancy with other addins that we purchase and make available.   We also worked on some small bugs and improvements to the existing tools.  You will also see a brand new look and feel. Multi-Story Stairs There have been significant improvements to this feature to allow you to have a single stair element even when the floor to floor height changes on different levels of your project. Railings You can now use topography to host railings as well as better automatic adjustment of railings related to the stair improvements. Coordination Models You can now link a Navisworks model into Revit to give you better context and check downstream models from any other model types through Navisworks. In addition to these enhancements and new features listed above, there are many smaller improvements that have been made.   These include; scheduling model groups and Revit links and adding parameters to those elements, organizing schedules in the project browser, dynamo player improvements to include user inputs from a script that would be run, small improvements to section box interactivity, improvements to the fill pattern tool and remembering the location of last loaded family. You can read more about these here; 2018 2018.1 2018.2 CAUTION Revit 2016 and older models to Revit 2017 or 2018 models With a few of these new features, there are some known bugs with upgrading models.   Please consult with your local DAM and run tests before upgrading a project.   Our recommendations are that projects heading toward issuing CDs or already in the construction phase should seriously consider whether they should stay with the current version or if there is a serious benefit with stability or new features that would warrant the upgrade to 2018.   Projects earlier on in the design process should just plan an upgrade into their project schedule at a convenient time and run test to see the consequences of the change.   As always any project model upgrades should be part of a BIM Execution Plan and should be well coordinated with all our consultants and others impacted by the use of Revit models. The most important known issue is the movement of text as a result of the fundamental rebuild of the text tool in Revit.   In 2018 this text improvement now includes tags and other annotations in addition to general notes and text.   This means the location of returns and layout of text dialog boxes on your sheet might not always be identical to what you saw in your 2016 or previous version models.   This includes text overlaps, word wrap changes, and text alignment issues in tags, marks, and text elements.   All of these are really easy to fix but it will take time to review your sheets and find them as there is no way to automate this process.   We have already made the fixes to our firmwide standard content so moving forward any new projects will just enjoy the benefits of this new feature.   (see examples below) In addition to text issues, there have been reported problems with railings as a result of the new hosting features so pay attention to those in your upgrade testing.",

    "content": "Most projects that we do at our firm are large (in Revit terms) and thus require us to split our Revit model into multiple files. There is an infinite number of ways this could be done on any project but below are some best practice guidelines to use in order to maximize efficiencies while going through the process of designing and documenting for your project.   Unfortunately knowing these key considerations does not mean there aren’t competing interests between them that force you to make a choice, there is no perfect model split.   It is, however, necessary to keep the software running effectively and keep teams moving forward on work and less time waiting for the model to ‘catch up’. Split models to as few as possible .  More model splits will generally equate to more time managing things that need to be consistent between the models, such as view templates, sheet noting such as general notes and legends, and other standards.  It also will take more effort keeping modified families consistent for a project that occur in multiple models.  Splitting models are much easier than combining.  Start lean, with fewer models, and split later as required. MODEL SPLIT CONSIDERATIONS There are four primary things to think about to determine the best way to divide your project. Building / Space design Task assignments Total size (SF which equates to MB) Deliverables and packages 1. THE DESIGN We never want to divide our models such that part of a design feature, space layout, element or other is part of two separate models. If we did something like this it would negatively impact the team members experience while trying to work on that part of the design, it will also impact the model size as the same elements will now be required to exist in multiple models. Think of building expansion joints as logical divisions, or wings of a building, or stacking of different uses in a tower all of which could be logical splits in the design.  Also, consider how our engineers and other design partners need to split their models. It is nice when model splits across all disciplines lineup but you can also use a combination of model division and worksets so that if architecture needs to be broken by building area but MEP needs to be broken by a system you can still accomplish this without needing to link too much into any given model. 2. THE WORK This decision should go hand in hand with the design but on complex teaming projects it may become an issue. When there are only a few people on the team getting the modeling and documentation done there is typically only one standard way to divide a project; shell & interior architecture. As the project gets larger and we introduce associate architects or multiple offices working on a project, who is actually tasked with which part of the work needs to be considered carefully? If you have team members who constantly have to open multiple models on a daily basis to move their part of the design forward you are creating a counterproductive situation. You also need to consider the number of people that will be on your team working in Revit and its busiest time (typically right before a deadline when everyone needs to move fast).  We see that there is a significant drop in model performance as you pass 6 concurrent users in a single model. It is not that you can’t go past this and in fact, Autodesk actually recommends a few more people but in order to keep your team working and not waiting for the software to catch up (since we are all accessing one central file even when we don’t realize we are), you want to keep your max team size per model to no more than 6. No amount of additional hardware or file size can fix that. 3. THE SIZE We are getting better and better metrics on just how much square footage (or meterage) equates to file size. Generally, we shoot for model sizes that don’t exceed 500 MB or so as a target. This isn’t a rule without some leeway but generally speaking, models that perform better (and thus quicker moving teams) start to reduce past that point without considerable due diligence by the team for model maintenance and care. This has gone up in some market sectors as our Revit teams are more skilled at Revit and our goals and use for the model increase to other things beyond documentation. At this point, our best guess is that 1,000 SF for your project will be about 2-4MB depending on the level of development and design density. So 100,000sf gets you to that 200-400 MB model give or take (design complexity also increases this factor). This can fluctuate greatly depending on what actually happens in a model and what content is used and the Level of Detail that content has. The point here is don’t expect a 1,000,000 SF building to be 1 single model and function effectively for the team. Now I am sure some of you might think, let’s just get better computational nodes but the problem is not our hardware. We already have more than enough hardware to run Revit efficiently, it is the software itself that has limitations on utilizing all the hardware we could give it. Thus, there still will always be a need to consider how we are going to split your project into multiple models. 4. THE SHEETS As much as possible, keep the live model and documentation elements together.   We are almost always required to deliver some sort of document packages for every project engagement we have. It is still one of our primary forms of communicating the design intent. On any basic design-bid-build project we have one single set going out at one point in time. This makes things easier from a planning point of view because now we only need to know which sheets relate to which parts of the building. That is why the most basic model division is shell & interior architecture because most of the shell sheets (except any full building sections) can easily be separated out and have minimal if any interior architecture that needs to show up on those sheets. This type of split also typically lines up with team task assignments with a few people working the exterior and the rest working the interior layout. When you are dealing with a project that requires multiple bid packages that go out at separate times then this might be an additional driver that helps the team determine how to divide the model. When you can make it work it is nice to have a single model that has the part of the building that is one system and made up of one document package. CONCLUSION Many factors contribute to the model size and the model size is only a part of the equation for Revit performance. Having a good plan in place in your BIM Execution Plan is really important. This does not mean you need to break up your models on the first day of design but have a solid plan with some reasoning from the points above for why you will be splitting things a certain way. Try to stick with it since moving parts from a model to another model is never an easy process and it is usually time-consuming. Anything you can have planned and set with Revit setup only helps the team to have time later for the design work itself instead of remedial steps to reconfigure Revit to work. Also make sure that the team follows best practices and avoids some of those things that contribute to large model size and poor model performance like; forgetting to purge and compact your model regularly, using in-place families instead of loadable families, importing items instead of linking them, exploding imported items, and using overly detailed manufacturers models without having a need for that detailed use.",

    "content": "Perkins+Will researchers and designers joined forces for a two-day workshop in Vancouver, September 11th and 12th, to implement DiSCovery , a  collaborative multi-objective optimization process developed by the Process and Energy Labs. Based on the Design Space Construction framework, DiSCovery is a social and computational performance-based workflow in which designers guide stakeholders to set goals for their design and enables Perkins+Will’s computational designers and analysts to unleash a suite of analytical tools to rapidly test a large number of parametrically-generated design options and find versions and trends that best achieves those goals. Process Lab members and Vancouver designers during the workshop. Look at the focus on those faces. SETUP & GEOMETRY CREATION For this workshop, the participants focused on the second floor of an arts and sciences building ( fig. 1 )  of a project the Vancouver office is currently taking through schematic design. The goals were to maximize the percentage of floor area that achieves daylight autonomy and minimize energy use. The design team developed a series of modular panels with various glazing sizes and locations ( fig . 2 ). Designers selected a panel variant for each location on the facade and recorded those selections in an excel spreadsheet ( fig . 3 ) that controls the parametric model, built using Rhino and Grasshopper. In addition to selecting the panel type for each location, the designers also controlled the depth of window shading on the South, East, and West sides. The resulting geometry ( fig . 4 ) is passed to the next step in the workflow where it is processed by the daylight and energy analysis engines. fig . 1 fig . 2 fig . 3 – Each row in the excel file represents one configuration of panels and shading depths to be tested. fig . 4 – One configuration of the design model ENERGY & DAYLIGHT ANALYSIS The geometric elements from the design model ( fig . 5 ) are separated by how they function in the analysis engines and assigned the parameters necessary for the analysis engines to perform their calculations. For lighting analysis, glazing is given a light transmittance value. Opaque elements, such as window shades, floors, and interior and exterior walls, are defined as shading objects. For energy analysis, the glazing is given a U-Value and a Solar Heat Gain Coefficient. Insulation and heat absorption properties are defined for walls, floors, and the roof; the elements that make up the building enclosure. Additionally, the interior zones are assigned heating loads based on the program of those spaces, along with HVAC parameters such as heating and cooling set points, ventilation, equipment load, and more. Each configuration takes about 3 minutes to analyze. fig. 5 – Building elements are separated and assigned analysis parameters DISCOVER* THE BEST DESIGN(S) The input values and analysis results are uploaded to a web application that visualizes the data as a parallel coordinates plot (PCP, fig. 6 ) alongside images of each configuration’s lighting analysis diagram (f ig. 7 ). Each column in the PCP is one of the panel or shading selection parameters or analysis result. Each blue polyline represents a single design configuration, tracing its values as it moves from column to column. Designers can filter which configurations are visible by restricting the range of values in any of the columns. For example, if you only wanted to show the results which performed well in the energy use analysis you would clamp that column to only show those lines in the upper portion of the column. Multiple columns can be clamped simultaneously. An individual design can be shown by clicking on its blue line. * See what I did there? fig. 6 – Parallel coordinates plot of the inputs and results of all design configurations. Click here to access the interactive PCP. fig . 7 – Diagram showing illuminance values (lux). Anything between the two extreme colors is considered an acceptable result. RESULTS Prior to the 2-day workshop Process Lab members, with the assistance of Cheney Chen , Vancouver’s sustainable building advisor, used this workflow to run 288 unique design configurations and several met the Passivhaus standard for energy use, which the project is targeting, while still achieving stellar daylight autonomy. These 288 combinations obviously only represent a small fraction of the possible window and shading combinations and several preliminary runs were executed to narrow the final tested combinations. For more information on the process used to achieve this reduction contact Victor Okhoya . Given the workshop’s short time frame, and the three minutes required to analyze each combination, the participants were only able to compare a limited number. Even so, they produced results approaching those of the Process Lab. FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES The primary goal of this workshop was to familiarize designers with the DiSCovery workflow, and in that, it was incredibly successful. The project team will continue to use it for design exploration and analysis of the facade, but DiSCovery is already being adapted to assist with other design problems. On the afternoon of the workshop’s second day, several of the Vancouver office’s design leaders and the Process Lab discussed the other potential uses for DiSCovery . The next implementation will focus on generating and analyzing options for overall building massing to be used in conceptual design. GET INVOLVED If you’re inspired to take advantage of the power of DiSCovery or have ideas for other ways in which it can be used reach out to John Haymaker , Perkins+Will’s director of research and leader of Process Lab.

    "content": "Password: DA This short animation was created for the Facades Plus conference held in Miami on January 2017. The projects featured in the animation were the Miami-Dade Kendall Academic Support Center, and the Florida International University Academic Health Sciences 4. Under the guidance of Pat Bosch and Angel Suarez, the animation evolved from an ambition to narrate the logic behind the making of the two facade systems. Rather than showing a catalog of still images in the facade logic, the fluid transitions and transformations, we believed, conveyed a more effective sequential narrative of the design intent. At the same time, different than a rendered walk-through or fly-through animation, which are often used to represent the final stages of design, our aim was rather to create a diagrammatic animation of the thought process from the initial concept phase to the completed building. The software used for the animation were Rhinoceros 3D with Bongo as well as AfterEffects for post production. Our original strategy was to use 3dMax and V-ray to generate the animation, but later found the diagrammatic graphics more easily generated through Rhino and its ability to export vector lines. The entire process took approximately two weeks, including the initial storyboarding process, the remodeling and simplifying of Revit geometry in Rhino, as well as the production of diagrams, drawings, and collages included in the animation. One lesson learned from animating and storyboarding each project is that this process can also serve as a design tool to map, organize, and clarify our design and the relationship between its components and systems.

    "content": "In the past the process of upgrading models was a painful and dangerous road.   Revit was not the most stable platform 5-6 years ago and the amount of change between versions was always causing issues with our existing models.   This was always something that took time and energy to test and/or commit to doing for any team and project. The process to upgrade your project to the next version of Revit is not as scary or difficult as it used to be. The development team has had performance and stability as two top priorities in any new Revit version over the last 6 years.   Not only does this mean that a newer version of Revit is better for you and your project models but also the upgrade process is producing less and less issues. In addition to Revit becoming better, our internal tools to assist this process have greatly improved.  Now you can use a tool like Clarity to archive your models before the upgrade.   You can also use Clarity to print all the sheets to PDF before the upgrade and then again after.   This will allow you to use bluebeam to compare the documents and show you if there are any changes between the two.  It is still best practice to upgrade through each version of Revit if you are moving up multiple versions, so don’t just go straight from 2014 to 2017, but rather step through 2015 and 2016 on the way. ​You should still  have covered this in your project’s BIM Plan and you should communicate and coordinate with all consultants and others who also use Revit so there is a coordinated movement of entire project team to the next version of the product.   One other thing to be aware of is that there was a fundamental change to how text is created in Revit so anything 2016 and older that would be converted to 2017 or 2018 would possibly experience some small text realighment to watch out for.   Again this can be discovered by comparing printed sets before and after using bluebeam.

    "content": "​After returning from the BiLT NA 2017 Conference my personal take on the experience was really a “back to to work” kind of mentality. In the last couple of years I felt that classes and speeches were gimmicky; check out VR…look what I can do with dynamo that means really nothing…but when i showed up for my first class I got a sense of ok…now that the wow is over here is how we can actually do something! ​This years event was held at the Westin Harbour Castle on the shores of Lake Ontario. A very cosmopolitan city it was quite the experience. There were over 500+ attendees for the Revit centric technical conference making it one of the larger non-Autodesk events. The classes were intermediate to advanced which has always been the reason I choose to go to the BiLT (formerly RTC) conference and was not disappointed. In one of my classes I got an interesting take away regarding tags that were sized for Furniture Spec sheets which I will also apply to our Room Data Sheet Tag here in MIN. As I stated, a back to Revit solution to common problem that just hadn’t crossed my mind that way before. ​I will continue to attend BiLT in the future and I recommend you join me! Any questions please feel free to reach out! I agree with Adam – this was not about Autodesk sales, it was about achievable goals using techniques available today. The conference focus was not only on Revit user techniques, but also included dashboards for project performance which help to identify “teachable moments” as well as additional tools like Bluebeam, Revizto, anaytics using Power BI and other available technology. Here is a simple but elegant tip that we can use immediately: When preparing your project for upgrade, in addition to usual procedures, print all views and sheets to PDF. After upgrade, print again, then use Bluebeam compare function. This will help in identifying missing dimensions, differently sized text and other pesky visual issues often associated with upgrades.

    "content": "We have developed a robust design coordination workflow, which we define as the process of validating the constructability of the design intent, to reduce project delivery risks through the early detection and resolution of constructability conflicts. Our teams use digital tools and good modeling workflows to more efficiently discover and resolve potential issues that could result in unexpected costs and delays during construction. We achieve this through facilitating engagement between different team members, connecting the silos of information, and creating accountability between all parties, to resolve the complex issues that occur in every design process. At defined intervals, in conjunction with other quality control reviews, the design models are aggregated and analyzed for constructability by design teams or in-house specialists. The identified issues are quantified based on risk scores and distributed to the design team for resolution in real-time through a cloud-based, collaborative issue tracker. The key to this process is an organized and consistent workflow, allowing the team to find solutions to the complex challenges they face in delivering modern buildings. This proactive approach to early resolution of constructability issues during design streamlines project delivery and construction efforts. Our clients have embraced this process as a strategy for reducing project risks associated with constructability, related RFI’s, and Change Orders during construction, thus mitigating the unknown costs that can mount during the building process.This allows projects to stick to their budgets and meet their schedules. For projects that have early contractor involvement in design, we have successfully used cloud collaboration services to extend Lean’s “Big Room” strategy of collaboration beyond the limits of collocated teams. The flexibility provided by this virtual collaboration technology creates significantly more productive and well-timed collaboration engagements without the productivity compromises involved in collocating large teams. As a result, the project benefits from reduced cost and fewer headaches during construction. These design coordination methods enable us to deliver a great design, as it was intended, for our clients. *If the document above requires login to view click on this link to log into box and then return back to this Pulse page and refresh the page. Background: All office technical design directors were given the opportunity to participate in the above presentation, that was put together by a small group of practicioners at the firm and the digital practice team. They looked at finding the most effecient tools and process to go through this risk mitigation process, that every project should do at some level, based on the project’s complexity and size. Revizto and iConstruct are currently office or project expenses, but have been piloted and have already proven a great deal of value in improving efficiency and quality of going through these design efforts.

    "content": "Real-time rendering has finally arrived! By running Enscape on a High Performance graphics machine, real-time renderings and live walkthroughs can be created instantaneously with a click of a button. Unlike traditional visualization software, Enscape uses the computer’s GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) to create real-time renderings for visualizations and animations. What does this all mean for our designers? It means reduced rendering time, faster design iterations, real-time design reviews and interactive client presentations. Before Enscape, the standard process for creating rendered images or a walkthrough was a somewhat tedious process. It required the designer to assign materials and lighting inside Revit or export the model to 3D Studio Max for a higher quality rendering. After the prep work is completed, the designer would then submit the job to a rendering queue and wait for the image or video to be processed. The rendering process itself could take minutes, hours or even days depending on the size and complexity of the scene. After the rendering is finished, the images or video often need to be post processed in software such as Photoshop or after effects for the finishing touches. With Enscape, the prep work is simplified and directly done within the design application without the need for exporting to another rendering application. With one click of a button, you can visualize the live rendered model in a matter of seconds. The live model allows you to walk through the design using a mouse and keyboard, an Xbox controller or a VR headset. You can also export out as many rendered still images, panoramas, walkthroughs and fly-by videos directly from Enscape. Currently, Enscape works as a plugin for both Revit and Sketchup, which is great news for all the SketchUp designers in the firm. You can use Enscape to “quickly put together presentation renders as you design”, says Michael Wiser-Ward from our North Carolina office. He added that “Enscape allows us to ‘hit print’ on our design rather than go through a longer process of generating presentation quality material.  Not only do we produce refined presentation images effortlessly, we can walk through the space live with the client and make changes and adjustments in the presentation.  Enscape for SketchUp is easy to use and has a very quick turnaround.  Most people in our NC office already know how to use SketchUp. Bringing them up to speed with Enscape takes around half an hour of overview.” Enscape’s interactive sun and shadow feature has also proven to be a very useful tool in helping project teams resolve design issues related to sun and glare issues.  Senior Project Architect, Floyd Cline II, shared how the Atlanta office used Enscape to resolve a major design issue that the team had been dealing with for month. “We were able to bring in the Revit model that was started in 2012, into Enscape and do a live simulation of the sun’s impact to the atrium space by dragging the time scale and following shadows.  We conducted the meeting over a live  and we were able to refine our solution [in] real-time.  Being able to walk around the space and rotate the view to test the sun impact from any vantage point was a major positive for us.” Using Enscape for real-time design review and client presentation has proved to be a great time saver for project teams. Design issues get resolved at a much faster pace than the traditional design review process of showing plans, elevation or static renderings. According to Project Architect Damian Ponton, “the Miami office has been very happy with Enscape. We have done walkthroughs with four separate clients to great success. The clients were very happy with the process, as is leadership. I think the success of Enscape has something to do with how easy we can get the Revit model into VR. We saved time by not having to create multiple perspectives to communicate the design intent. We do have to make sure the model is clean, but that just means we have to be disciplined on how we model. Enscape is a great addition to our design process”. Project Designer, Christopher Karlson from our Boston office also added that with “Enscape’s ‘White Mode’ feature, [they were] able to keep views diagrammatic if necessary (with no materials shown)” to better understand the design concept and the geometry of the space. As designers become more familiar with the Enscape tool, they have started to use Enscape while they are designing. Our DC Design Application Manager, Justin Benjamin, reported that the designers have started using the graphics laptop that has Enscape loaded along with their regular laptop that they use to run Revit on the nodes. They would make changes in the Revit model, then save to central and refresh the model in Enscape to view the design changes instantaneously. We have also found that their preferred method of presenting Enscape live is using the Xbox controller while projecting to a large screen. Even though Enscape is quite an amazing visualization software, it does not solve all the rendering problems we have. It will not be replacing the very detailed and refined high-end renderings anytime soon. “Enscape also requires a near flawless Revit model for it to work,” commented Dan Creekmore, director of Viz Lab, “We ultimately couldn’t use it because none of our active projects were constructed at a level that we could show a client.” Another restricting factor is Enscape’s system requirement. To achieve real-time rendering performance, Enscape needs to run on a super graphic machine with a High Performance graphics card, which currently is an expensive and limited resource that is not available to all the staff. This hardware requirement explains the limited adoption rate of Enscape around the firm. However, as more designers and project architects see the value of using Enscape, the technical and resource issues will be resolved to meet the need of our design teams. Hopefully, in the near future, everyone can enjoy real-time design right on their desktop! Create folder Add file Add comment",

    "content": "Two of the most rapidly advancing technologies in architectural media are drone photography and virtual reality.  Both have seen major advances in the last two years and are becoming more and more common tools used to talk about architecture. Today, we can represent interior spaces in VR with a fairly high level of fidelity and realism.  Exteriors, however, present some unique challenges when we try to represent full site context with the same level of realism.  Landscaping is notoriously complex and therefore computationally intensive.  Urban landscapes and their mixture of buildings, cars, benches, street lights and other entourage are even more complex by several orders of magnitude. To produce these scenes in a reasonable amount of time and within a practical budget, artists find ways to simplify the scene.  Surrounding buildings might be represented as simple masses.  Items closer to the horizon tend to get replaced with generic billboard scenes.  Landscaping and entourage beyond the immediate site gets skipped or significantly simplified. We recently had the opportunity to develop a virtual-reality scene for a confidential urban project.  This scene was an outdoor terrace on a high-rise in the middle of a dense urban setting.  This immediately presented a variety of challenges for VR.   The landscaping complexity within our project was going to consume a large amount of our computational capacity leaving little if any left over for all the modeling required to show the streets and buildings surrounding the site.  Furthermore, we needed to show views from multiple levels, so simple tricks we often use in the rendering world weren’t going to work. The solution we arrived at was to use drone photography to represent the surrounding detail.  A local drone photographer was able to take full (or nearly full) panoramic images at the proposed site at a couple altitudes. We incorporated this imagery into our scene by mapping it onto a sphere around the scene.  Initially we struggled with curvature issues when the user was viewing the model from off center of the capture point, especially on tall buildings close to the site.  But after some trial and error with positioning and scale of the image, we achieved a convincing effect that was stunning when viewed with our scene in VR. Using real photography brought a dramatic improvement to the realism and immersiveness of the project.  Users could walk to the edge of balconies and look out over the city exactly as they will be able to in the completed structure. We were also able to write a custom script that selects the most appropriate drone photography to match the elevation the viewer is at.  So views from upper floors correctly represented the scenes users saw from windows and balconies. We have been enthusiastically exploring the wide range of possibilities virtual reality brings to the table and were excited to see what happened when we merged media together from these two emerging technologies.  Looking forward to pushing this even further!

    "content": "The Bluebeam Advantage ​In the following article we will look at some of the many tools that make Bluebeam stand above our old Adobe Acrobat. While there is a plethera of functions and tools that let it stand apart we will discuss 10 of the popular functions that will help you get the most out of this efficiency building application. Customizable Interface and Profiles Revu comes with a variety of different default profiles which will optimize your interface for different workflows. You aren’t limited to just these profiles though; the entire interface is customizable. Display the tools you actually use, hide the ones you don’t care about, and set up your toolbars exactly the way you like them. Once you’ve gotten everything set up to your liking, you can save these settings as a new custom profile. If you’d like to share these profiles with other users, you can easily export them for emailing or saving to a team network drive. For other users to import your profile, it’s as simple as just double clicking on the file. Tool Chest Creating and customizing markups in Revu is extremely easy, but you don’t want to have to keep re-creating the same markups again and again. This is where the Tool Chest shines, allowing you to create custom toolsets where you can save those markup tools for future use. Just like profiles, tool sets can be exported and shared with other users. This not only cuts down on wasted time from various team members recreating markups, but it also helps tremendously with standardization. You can create color-coded markups for specific subjects or workflows (blue for electrical notes, green for plumbing, etc.), for different teams, or whatever makes sense for your uses. Markups List As you’re making notes on a document, the markups list provides an easy way to keep track of all of your markups in an interactive spreadsheet-style interface that you can sort and filter. Like the rest of Revu, you can customize the columns in the markups list however you prefer. In addition to simply toggling certain columns on or off, you can create custom columns with drop-down options or formula calculations. You can then use these to assign statuses, set material types, perform takeoffs, and more Import CommentsLet’s say that you’ve emailed a drawing to multiple people, they’ve added their markups and then sent their copies back to you. If you’d like to import all of those markups from the separate PDFs onto your master copy, “import comments” allows you to do so with a few clicks. You will never have to waste any more time tracing or recreating other peoples’ markups, you can simply import them right onto your own drawing. You can find the import comments tool along the top of your markups list after you’ve expanded it. Compare Documents When you are working with multiple versions of drawings, it can sometimes be difficult to determine exactly what has changed between revisions. Having to visually scan between drawings to find differences is not only time consuming, but also leaves plenty of room for human error. Bluebeam offers two different methods of document comparison to solve this problem; firstly, you can “overlay documents”, which produces a light table effect with color coded revisions stacked on top of one another. Also, there is “compare documents”, which automatically compares drawings pixel-by-pixel and adds clouds around all of the differences. Either of these methods will allow you to find the differences between drawings far more quickly and accurately Visual Search The concept of searching within PDFs is not a new one, but with Revu you can not only search for text, you can also search for symbols in your drawing. It will even catch these symbols if they are rotated, a different color, or have lines passing over them. Once you’ve generated your search results, you can highlight them, hyperlink them, count them, and much more. There are many different applications for this, such as quickly hyperlinking all of your details or performing quantity takeoffs. Automark If your document doesn’t have page labels properly set up, quickly navigating to the correct page you need can be difficult. Until recently, if you wanted to update all of your labels it was a long and manual process of typing them all out, page by page. AutoMark allows you to automatically rename all of your page labels by using bookmarks or a page region (such as the page numbers at the bottom of your sheets). In Revu 12 this feature was further refined by letting you select multiple page regions, as well as setting prefixes and suffixes. Batch Link Batch Link is only available in Revu eXtreme, and we feel is probably the most compelling reason to invest in that version. As we outlined in our prior blog post, it allows you to automatically batch create hyperlinks using file names, page regions, or page labels. Setting up hyperlinks in your document is tremendously helpful not only for you, but for anyone that ever uses it. It makes navigation much faster and easier, especially if you’re working with large document sets. PDF Creation Plugins All 3 versions of Revu come with direct plugins for the MS Office Suite (Word, Powerpoint, Excel, Outlook, etc) that add PDF creation buttons right into your menu ribbon. Revu CAD and Revu eXtreme also provide plugins for AutoCAD, Navisworks, Solidworks, Revit, and SketchUp Pro. Batch creation of high quality, vector-based PDFs has never been easier! Studio All versions of Revu come with free access to Bluebeam Studio, their collaboration platform. You have unlimited storage space, can upload any file type, are able to have up to 500 simultaneous users marking up a PDF, and best of all you can even collaborate with users that don’t even own Bluebeam. You can simply invite them to join your Session or Project by using their free PDF viewer, Bluebeam Vu. As long as they’re working within Studio, that free viewer unlocks the full suite of markup tools to allow the user to fully take part in project collaboration. ​There are many more reasons why we are switching to Bluebeam, take some time to explore the software and find your own benefits!

    "content": "Managing details across multiple Revit models can be a time consuming chore in any Revit project. On a large project a with distributed team and multiple models it can become a daunting task and take many hours of coordination. Detail Referencing Utility (DRU) solves this problem of referencing views contained on the sheets in different Revit models. It was initially piloted by Digital Practice in collaboration with the Swedish First Hill project team, and now is also used on projects in the Los Angeles and Miami offices. Based on the results of the pilot projects, Digital Practice recommends implementing DRU on large projects where it will be most useful, those with multiple models and large teams. It works well with distributed teams in multiple offices, making collaboration much easier. This tool enables teams to cross-reference views across multiple Revit models. For example, all details can be kept in a separate file(s) and called out from other models. The reference labels will be automatically updated when details are moved to different sheets or their numbers are updated, similar to how it works when you move a detail to a different sheet within the same model. This tool can work with any view type and is not limited to working with details and drafting views. It can also create intelligent text notes when referencing a view in a different model. DRU has a robust user interface and project teams find it easy to learn. It has proven itself very resilient, with utilities to check, diagnose, and repair broken links as well as utilities to track changes. An additional advantage of using DRU is being able to set up separate detail models and have some team members work in those detail models, while others work in the main models. It is huge help in minimizing the number of concurrent people in any one model. For successful implementation of DRU it is important to have a plan for which sheets reside in each model and which views reside on the sheets. Special consideration should be given to projects which have deliverable packages that may share details but need to be delivered separately. In this scenario, details which are not part of all packages should not reside on the same sheet. However DRU has utilities for splitting models and patching the connection later in the project should the need arise. Notes: All Revit files (within P+W’s scope) for a project need to be pre-configured to use the utility. The plugin will not work in any project that is not pre-configured for DRU. Piloting project teams are: Swedish First Hill (Contact: Julie Adler, Seattle) Providence Tarzana Med Ctr. (Contact: Dean Demko, Los Angeles) JHS West (Contact: Jose Barcelona, Miami) It is best to start working with DRU at the very beginning of the Design Development phase If “dummy” callouts were used in early phases, they need to be replaced Contact your office’s Design Applications Manager or Helen Gorina for more information and updates.",

For those that follow Autodesk news, you probably already know that the 2018 versions of their products have been released. This includes Revit, 3d Max, Navisworks, AutoCad and others. Perkins+Will has a team of people that work to prepare the rollout of software. This includes preparing an installation, creating new templates & content, updating internally developed tools and having a rollout plan for the entire firm. As quickly as we want to move, there are many steps and precautions that need to be taken, in order to minimize any impact to our design teams. To that end we also follow the release cycle of Autodesk which has slightly changed over the last few years to include a major improvement to their Revit product in the fall with many new features. After they release updates to this we typically start piloting the software and rolling it out for everyone. As you can imagine the licensing, installations on nodes, connection to other products, 3rd party addins and library of resources are all interconnected we need to make sure all of that is ready for everyone before we can make it available to you. You will see information on the availability of Revit 2018 in the fall when all those things mentioned above come together.   As your project partners ask about this please inform them it will not be ready at our firm till later this year at which point you can update your project models to take advantage of its new features.",

    "content": "Building Information Modeling (BIM) is nothing new. Revit was first released in 2000 and Perkins+Will adopted BIM processes over a decade ago. Yet even given how integral these data-rich models have become to our work, our deliverables often remain stacks of paper. Before BIM, drawing was the design process, and while the transition from paper to computer screen involved a technological shift, a line with a pencil is conceptually similar to one drawn with a mouse. Designs emerged piecemeal by combining individual drawings. The challenge was to coordinate these myriad separate documents into a coherent whole, maintaining consistency between them. Switching from drawing to modeling as the primary production activity fundamentally changed how designs are generated, and while having a 3D representation of a design enables us to analyze and communicate our ideas in ways that were previously impossible, such as daylight analysis and computer-generated renderings, it also introduces a gap between developing a design and producing drawings of it. Drawing has become a secondary activity in the design process. This gap between modeling and drawing is apparent when marking desired revisions, an activity commonly known as ‘red-lining’. The intent is to refine the drawing so it communicates the desired information in a clear and concise way. This task is rightfully executed by the more experienced members of a project team, those who have significant practice producing drawing sets have a more finely developed understanding of what the final product should look like. However, experience usually distances these people from executing production tasks themselves. If they haven’t done so in the past ten years they may have never used Revit on a regular basis and therefore not be familiar with how the changes that they are requesting will be executed in a BIM environment. Here are a few things to keep in mind when red-lining drawings produced in Revit: BIM is object-oriented. Most of what you see in drawings are objects in 3D space. Objects can be physical, such as a wall, or conceptual, like a room, the space bounded by walls, a floor and a ceiling. Revit has a pre-defined object taxonomy that it uses to organize and keep track of these objects. From largest to smallest they are… Category > Family > Type > Instance Category: The broadest object classification, e.g. ‘Doors’, ‘Windows’, ‘Walls’… Family: Available objects that belong to a particular category. Loadable families are individual .RFA files which are loaded into a revit project (.RVT file). System families live within a project and cannot be saved as external files. Type: A family can contain multiple pre-defined types. One type is different from another because they have different parameter values. Instance: A single element placed at a particular location in the 3D model. Views are slices through the objects placed in a project. How those objects appear are a combination of the view properties and the object properties. Views properties include: View Range: Plans, sections and elevations all have a plane that defines the view and settings for how far in front of and behind (or above and below) that plane you want to see. Visibility/Graphics Settings: This is the motherlode of graphics control! These settings determine what categories of objects are visible in the view and the outline and fill styles of those objects. Below is a list of object properties that you can use to affect its graphic display style. These settings can be shared between multiple views using View Templates, updating all views when the View Template is modified. Filters: Can be used to control an object’s visual style based on the value of one of its parameters. Object properties used to control graphic style: Cut or Projection? Does the view plane cut through the object or is the object behind that plane? You can control both the outline and surface fill for each of these situations. Category and Subcategory: E.g. ‘Door’ is a category. ‘Panel’ and ‘Frame’ are subcategories within the ‘Door’ category. Display settings can be controlled down to the subcategory level. Annotations can also be coordinated between drawings by using tags and keynotes instead of text boxes. Tags: A tag displays the parameter values of an object. Using tags instead of view-specific text boxes ensures consistency between all drawings and schedules that reference that object. Keynotes: Drawing notes can be kept in an external text file and referenced by a code known as a ‘key’. If a note relates to a particular object the key is a parameter value stored in the object. General drawing keynotes are selected from the text file as you place the note. This method allows you to update that note in all drawings by changing the referenced text file or changing the object’s key parameter value. Type and Instance Parameters: Parameters can be defined as either ‘type’ or ‘instance’. Type parameters will have the same value as all other objects of the same type. Instance parameters can be different from one element to the next, even if they are the same type. (See the taxonomy above) When creating detail views it is not necessary to model a 3D object exactly as it exists in the real world. Model only the 3D geometry necessary to coordinate the location of the object relative to those around it, then add detail components (see below) and drafted lines in the view for additional information. Similar to blocks in AutoCAD, detail components are families made up of only 2D elements, such as drafted lines and filled regions. They do not have any 3D geometry, but they do have parameters which store information about them. Use detail components whenever you want to show standard or repeated elements in your detail views. If you change a detail component family it will update in all the drawings where it is used. Combining detail components with keynotes is a powerful detailing workflow. If you only remember one thing, remember this; drawings are connected to one another because they are views of a single 3D model . Use this connection to your advantage by modeling accurately and use an object’s properties to store information about it, rather than drawing isolated lines in a single view. There will be times when it will be necessary to draw flat lines to communicate design intent, but try to use the object-oriented nature of BIM to your advantage. The benefits are better drawing coordination, fewer errors and a more efficient production process. Happy red-lining! Create folder Add file Add comment",

    "content": "Written by: Michael Shyu Our innovation incubator project focused on utilizing Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality as an all-encompassing architect’s toolset which can be used from initial conceptual massing, to real scale design visualization in space through construction administration phase as an on-site clash detechtion tool. Our team was diverse and widespread and consisted of Michael Shyu, Xie Fie, Chance Heath and Ryan Zhang of MIT Media Lab/GSI, with Iffat Mai as our lead advisor. The Hardware The platform we utilized was the cutting edge Microsoft HoloLens which is a fully immersive, standalone headset that overlays 3D spatial information over a transparent OLED screen. The headset is equipped with top of the line sensors and cameras that are capable of overlaying a 3D virtual mesh (SLAM) over a real physical space. The HoloLens itself is currently still a development tool that is sought out by VR developers to experiment with the potential usage of Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality(MR) in real spaces. The Process Our initial project focused on trying to utilize HoloLens for an outdoor site, but due to technical hardware limitations, construction schedule, and the need for frequent field test of the device that limited us under that scope. We refocused the project onto an empty floor above the Perkins + Will’s Boston office and created a hypothetical project that would allow us to rapidly test and create content, which would become the basis for future Augmented Reality / Mixed Reality (AR/MR) work in Perkins&Will. In order to execute this lofty idea, the process and project had to be goal and milestone driven, while also being agile enough to adjust to the research challenges of developing on a brand new hardware while learning to code using the Unity3D game engine. We conducted seven field tests and interviewed multiple people of different roles and skill sets to refine the scope of a tool needed for the office. Each test pushed specific limits of the hardware and software and tested our assumptions of what was needed for the office and how it would be represented and could be presented on the HoloLens screen. The Product The product consisted of three main functions, the Model Observatory, Interior Design Options, and the CA Assistant, which could all activated by voice and “air tap” command, as well as curated by a series of visual tutorials. The Model Observatory mode is how Augmented Reality was traditionally used to view a virtual model of a small object within the physical world. For our project, the Model Observatory was envisioned as a conceptual massing tool that could rapidly test out models en lieu of physical models. Interactions, such as turning on and off different layers and moving and hiding pieces of the building were pre built into our Model Observatory platform. With the Interior Design Options feature, we pushed the boundaries of immersive AR/MR design. We created a series of design options for a reception desk in the lobby space at full 1:1 scale, which tested the HoloLens’s ability of alignment as well as the representation of high fidelity materials and textures that could reflect and refract to virtual environmental lighting. Model alignment was achieved by matching the physical space with the virtual model through Spatial Localization and Mapping (SLAM), and it was scaled by a scalar modifier function. The user interface is how one interacts with the various design options and is a floating semi-transparent window that can be repositioned and hidden as one moves through the space. The materials were optimized video game materials that were able to dynamically reflect and refract based on the position of the user, this level of realism in physical on site space can only be achieved by the HoloLens as of the writing of this post. The model geometries were created in both Rhino and Revit, as a test of model fidelity in the HoloLens. There were both curvilinear forms and orthogonal forms, which were intentionally created to test the limits of the hardware on the material interactions. We selected a myriad of materials from concrete, marble, wood, and metals of varying shades of reflectivity and tones. The CA Assistant was the third and final function of the test. We wanted to demonstrate the HoloLens as a tool that could be used throughout the lifecycle of a project. We created a hypothetical situation in which we were outfitting the existing space with a new set of ductwork. The Hololens would detect a clash between the existing and the proposed and highlight that as a potential issue for review through a large red pulsing sphere. Once you click on the clash, an image and report was generated in plan, section and photograph, and the area would be flagged for further review back in the office. As the technical limitations of actually creating a software that could literally understand the space through machine learning was outside the scope and expertise of our project, we “pre-cooked” the scenario to demonstrate the future possibilities of this technology. Conclusions Augmented and Mixed Reality is a new territory generating a lot of buzz through major industry players. Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, and Google are all investing a lot into this technology but it is still very much in development industry wide. The ability to see each other and interact together in a shared experience is the real power of the technology and this social interaction is something that is very human. In order to understand how to use this tool, a few things need to be understood on a fundamental level. First one being AR is not VR and understanding that difference is critical.  VR is essentially industry standard at this point and has been optimized as a one-click solution whereas AR requires a lot of technical knowhow just to deploy. VR is an enclosed experience where one visualizes a new built space. AR relies on the real world and existing conditions in order to overlay information. The representation of AR is very different. You want it to be object focused and rely on as much of the existing background as possible in order to create the sense that the object is really there. Overlaying virtual elements that represent existing physical objects on top of the actual objects creates an unrealistic overlap which is visually unappealing and mentally confusing to the viewer. Presentation is everything. You have to test and walk through how you want to present and interact. The style is very different, and in order to utilize AR to its potential, one really needs to rethink how they present and interact with an audience. Put the HoloLens on. Test it. Use it and rehearse. An industry focused AR/MR will be the future and it is not a gimmick. The technology and sensors of SLAM, machine learning and simple raw computing power are all developing and converging. While there will always be bumps along the way, as HoloLens is still just a Beta platform, everyone will soon be using and experiencing AR/MR as commonly as the cellphones are used today in 5-10 years down the road.",

This two-day event features breakout sessions taught by the region’s top instructors and Autodesk technical experts. The general sessions and networking opportunities allow you to share ideas and insights with your peers, network with experts in your field, and explore the latest trends and technologies.” – Midwest-u.com The overarching themes would be Dynamo uses and Big Data in BIM. Classes are meant for the intermediate users to high-level BIM workflows. The conference brought together users from all AEC industries which allowed for good interoperability discussions and networking with different subs. Many of the big name firms from the Midwest had users in attendance. Classes were robust and easily of national conference quality, many speakers gave the same presentations as national level conferences at half the cost. Very enjoyable and definitely worth it. We were not just in attendance… Oh no, we presented!  Below are the (2) courses to which we were responsible. Everyday Dynamo: Automating Simple Solutions That Bridge Workflow Gaps Within Revit Presenters: Josh Moore (Dallas Office) & Justin Benjamin (Washington DC Office) Are you a Building Information Modeling (BIM) manager seeking to increase the efficiency of your company and project teams? Are you a model manager struggling through workflow issues? Or maybe you’re neither of those, but you work in Revit software every day and want to learn ways to work smarter. This class will focus on using visual programming in the Dynamo extension to bridge everyday workflow gaps within Revit software. The class will provide a brief overview of Dynamo and the many available packages that the Dynamo community has already created that can be used to automate many tasks. The class will also go over some basic tips and tricks you can use when setting up Dynamo, and we’ll troubleshoot. The remainder of the class will focus on specific examples that bridge workflow gaps and/or increase automation within Revit software. Example scripts will include the following: finding annotation styles within legends for model cleanup; coordinating dummy view tags across linked models; binding models without losing workset/phase information; swapping ceiling-based lights for face-based lights. This session features Dynamo Studio and Revit. AIA Approved Just a Shell Game – Utilizing Design Options to Maintain a Master Model Presenter: Adam Hamilton (Minneapolis Office) “The workflows of the BIM age are hitting obstacles. In my office we are faced with discipline specific challenges that have been solved using a unique method I wish to share. First, our Interiors team needed a method of remodeling different areas of a single building at the same time. Each team and area would need its own document package displaying the building as-constructed without any of the proposed changes in the other parallel projects. As a repeat client the intent would be to maintain the record model while tracking these progressing changes, and in the end unite all the work into one model.  Second, our Landscape team working on a commercial campus project needed to issue phasing packages for construction while continuing to develop the Master Scheme due to a restrictive time table. An unlikely ally emerged; utilizing Design Options in a Master Model we were able to manage an Existing building and Site model while developing in parallel multiple CD sets. This class will discuss the reasoning behind this method, the extent of management, and the issues and successes our teams were able to achieve. – Methods discussed could benefit all disciplines though examples shown relate to Architectural, Interior Design and Landscape.” All and all, this was a much more intimate setting than Autodesk University.  Which lent itself to a more friendly/collaborative chit chat amongst our peers.",

    "content": "Phillip Leidy is a project architect in NY office. He is sharing an efficient workflow utilizing FormIt, that he learned at Autodesk University 2016. As a long time  Sketchup and Revit user I was intrigued and excited  when I first saw FormIt while attending Autodesk University.  FormIt for me is very promising solution. FormIt gives you the modeling speed and flexibility of Sketchup with the integration and power of Revit. The program’s interface and behavior are very familiar to those accustomed to using Sketchup. Its basic structure of “push/pull” modeling and grouping for model structure are very similar to Sketchup. This for me is a huge advantage in attracting new users. It’s not a big learning curve for people accustomed to using Sketchup. I personally was able to get in and work with FormIt within about five minutes of playing around. Here was a program that looks and feels like Sketchup but is in the same family line as Revit. Modeling in FormIt is easy and intuitive for a Sketchup user, and without its big drawback which has always been that it lacks integration with a BIM workflow and that it was never intended for construction documentation. Before FormIt, I would use Sketchup for designs and presentations, and then use Revit for documenting and executing the project. This meant a good bit of wasted effort remodeling at each stage with every change. Also, when it comes to building families and really modeling anything in Revit, the modeling interface is a bit of a nightmare. It’s not very intuitive and speed isn’t really what the designers had in mind. Revit is most concerned with r elationships and information. This isn’t to say that modeling in Revit is impossible. I’ve met plenty of Revit geniuses, but for me and many users I’ve talked to, the modeling interface is a big problem. It sc ares off new users and frustrates competent modelers from other programs. The real power of FormIt comes from the programs interface with Revit. The two programs remain separate but fully compatible both forward (FormIt to Revit) and backward (Revit back to FormIt.) When brought into Revit, the grouping model structure is converted to the family structure that Revit users are familiar with. FormIt also allows you to assign Revit family types in FormIt so when you bring groups into Revit, Revit already knows how to classify and treat them. This means if you build out a basic site model or topography, you can just assign that as a site family, and Revit treats it like a site element. Any users who have had to model exactly how topography meets a building at an entrance know that Revit’s site tools are not exactly great for that kind of precision work. With FormIt you can model it exactly the way you want. Just assign it as a site element in FormIt and bring it into Revit. (If that topography changes, you can update it just as quickly and bring it back in.) In the past, when I used Sketchup, the big problem with my earlier design workflows was the lost time and effort when it came to double modeling. FormIt allows you to keep and work with that early geometry. This means that effort isn’t lost. Furthermore the back compatibility also means you can update and revise that geometry as needed. FormIt also has some powerful tool integration that remains was a big strength of Revit as well. FormIt has Dynamo and Energy Modeling built in. This means that in addition to quickly changing and modifying early design iterations, they can be driven dynamically with parametrics and analyzed for site and energy impacts. Basic building types like parking garages or hotels with set space requirements can be fully driven with dynamo scripting and dropped directly into your project site. My first live test of the FormIt to Revit workflow was on one of my current projects. The project’s team is well into construction, and needs to rework a lobby design (quickly!). We have a basic concept of what all the lobby millwork should look like, but it has not been fully modeled or drawn yet. Normally when it comes to checking millwork detailing (or detailing from shop drawings) I would quickly model this out in Sketchup to show the designer how the detailing changes impact the final design. This time, instead of double modeling here and building a separate 3D model of the millwork and then having a junior staff member draw and model it in Revit, I figured I’d give FormIt a try as comparison against my normal workflow. I built the millwork in FormIt and went through the design with the designer as usual. We were able to correct and change the design as needed to meet both the technical and design requirements. But now instead of handing the whole thing off to be rebuilt in Revit, I just converted my FormIt model into a millwork family for Revit and dropped it straight into the building model. From here junior staff were able to draw out the documentation details from the live geometry — no double modeling required. While I found this new workflow to be somewhat faster, the biggest advantage was the minimizing of mistakes from remodeling. The look that was modeled with the designer was exactly the geometry that was put into the Revit model and detailed without any additional effort. I do not claim to be a FormIt expert just yet, but I can already see the advantages to using this new program. I believe FormIt is able to solve two of Revit’s biggest shortcomings: it significantly increases both the speed and flexibility of design and pre-design modeling for Revit, and provides a way to easily and intuitively create complex geometry fully compatible with Revit environment. I am actively trying to get more people interested in FormIt so that we can further develop new workflows that can both speed up and reduce redundancy in our firms design process.",

    "content": "Herman Miller Showroom – March 22 nd 2017 Produced and Presented by: Dean Demko – Design Applications Manager Justin Brechtel – Senior Computational Designer Perkins + Will (P+W) was invited to the AIA Healthcare: Virtual Reality Showcase to demonstrate how they utilize Virtual Reality as a design tool for Healthcare. P+W maintains a close relationship with the medical professionals who will be users of the spaces designed during the design process. This design process includes reoccurring meetings with the user to gain valuable feedback which is used to help inform the architects and planners as to how the highly technical medical spaces should be planned. To help communicate the design to the medical professionals P+W uses many different methods to communicate the space. Amongst these methods are 2d lines drawings (plans, elevations, axonometric), renderings, full scale mock ups, and Virtual Reality. Full-scale mock ups are the closest thing to reality, but the cost of constructing the mock ups can add up and only a limited amount of spaces can be constructed. Virtual Reality allows P+W to rapidly create many more spaces than could be constructed and provides an environment, which medical professionals can immerse themselves and interact with the spaces as if they were in the finished building. For this demonstration, P+W used the model from an ICO Patient room, which they are currently designing. P+W uses a variety of design and production tools. The main production tool is Revit. Revit does not have the capability of creating Virtual Reality out of the box. To create the Virtual Reality environment P+W developed a workflow involving Revit, 3D Studio Max, Unity with the Unity Asset VRTK, and Oculus Rift with Oculus Touch. Seen below is the workflow diagram. This workflow allowed P+W to take the production model and add realistic materials, lighting, physics, and an interactive environment. This allows the users to not only step through the space as if it is real but also interact with the objects in the room, including moving tables, opening and closing doors and cabinets, and adjusting medical equipment which operate with overhead booms. This interactive environment allows the medical professionals to actually use the space, by walking through the space, moving equipment, and move through their standard working routines like they would in a finished building in operation. Medical professionals can then provide real working experience feedback to the designers that they could not provide by just reviewing 2d plans or renderings. https://www.aialosangeles.org/calendar/healthcare-committee-march-2017#.WQPM_ogrLmE Create folder Add file Add comment © 2013 Perkins+Will Contact administrator: Mr. Derek Veren",

    "content": "What is a Hololens? The latest buzz on the VR/AR scene is the Hololens. The Microsoft Hololens is such a revolutionarily new device that even among the VR/AR aficionados, the first question they ask is “what exactly is a Hololens?” The Hololens is a mixed reality (MR) headset device that projects virtual objects as 3D holographic images inside the headset over real physical objects. Unlike a VR headset, the Hololens headset is a clear visor that is transparent which enables user to see the virtual holograms overlaid on top of the real world environment and delivers a mixed reality experience for the user. In addition to projecting 3D holographic imagery, the Hololens is equipped with multiple cameras and sensors to help it understand the surrounding environment and establish a consistent inside-out tracking of the user and his location relative to his environment. With solid tracking, Hololens users can interact naturally with the virtual holograms inside the Hololens using gaze, gesture and voice control. What can designers do with the Hololens? For designers, the Hololens is a natural extension of a designer’s canvas. What better way to envision how a design will fit into a space than to immerse yourself into it? Put on the Hololens headset and insert the 3D design directly into the room you are designing and immerse yourself in a mixed reality space where the virtual objects appear, as a hologram, exactly where it would be in the real world. With the inside out tracking system, the Hololens scans the environment and creates an internal spatial mapping database to track where all the objects and surfaces are, such that if you insert a window on the wall, it will remain there even if you walk out of the room and come back later. You can interact with the 3D holograms by walking in it in this mixed reality space as you experience the design from every angle and every vintage point, just as you would in the real world. What’s more, you can dynamically make design changes and see the impact instantaneously in your mixed reality environment. Though most Hololens user’s first reaction to this mixed reality experience is a fantasy like surprise, the fact that mixed reality still maintains a strong connection to the physical world makes it so much easier for them to comprehend and accept the holograms as part of the new “reality, the mixed reality. Adding interactivity to the mixed reality further reinforces the realism of the holographic objects, making it easier for our brain to comprehend the experience thus resulting with none of the discomfort that is sometimes associated with VR experience. Socially, the Hololens experience is also much more socially engaging than the VR experience. As the Hololens users can still see through the headset, they are fully aware of their surroundings, and can continue to engage with the people around them. In fact, the Hololens can enhance the social experience as it can function as a collaborative tool. One way the Hololens can help collaboration is to bring collaborators together virtually. Imagine a user in the field surveying a site condition. If an issue arises and the user needs to consult with an expert remotely, he/she can simply call up the expert through skype using the headset, share with the expert what he/she sees through the headset, and collaborate on a solution right there on site. Another way the Hololens can help collaboration is through networked MR experience. By hosting a multi-user session that consists of multiple Hololens users, a project team can collaboratively discuss and work on their design model in the mixed reality world. The team can work in multiple scale modes as needed. Working in a model scale, the team can place the design model on a tabletop allowing the team to see the full extent of the project.  When they needed to explore a specific room, the team can switch to full-scale mode and immerse the whole team into a specific location inside the full-scale virtual model. Adding design option review to the process the team can review multiple design option this way instead of having to build many different physical models or physical mock up. Just imagine the efficiency that the project can gain simply by getting all the stakeholders into the same “room” whenever you need to, even when everyone is “dialing” in from different physical locations. How is Perkins&Will using the Hololens? Our Digital Practice (DP) team joined the early developer program for the Microsoft Hololens as soon as the device was released to developers, and has been working with several pairs of the Hololens headsets since then. Some of our project teams in Chicago and Seattle office have since been exploring the presentation features of the Hololens as they used the Hololens to share their design model with the client for design review and approval process. Several other Hololens research projects are currently underway around the firm. The “Hololens for design and construction process” project is being conducted as a joint effort by the Digital Practice team along with a Boston innovation incubator team and an MIT media lab researcher.  Another Hololens research project is the “Hololens for Multi-user Collaboration” which is a joint effort by the Digital Practice team, Viz Lab in Dallas and our Seattle office.

Mass Metrics 2 is a collection of digital tools built to specifically for our planning and large scale design projects. Each toolset includes a Rhino or Revit file and an Excel file with a client-facing dashboard. By scripting real-time takeoffs in Rhino and tying those takeoffs directly to a client-facing dashboard, you can eliminate data-drag on scenario testing and work in a seamless data-rich design modeling environment.  Use these toolsets at your desk, with your colleagues, or right in front of our clients. Mass Metrics 2 has 3 toolsets.  These toolsets can be used by themselves or in conjunction with one another. Mass Reporter Scenario Builder City Builder WHICH TOOLSET SHOULD I USE? Mass Reporter allows users to report takeoffs of their proposed massing in real-time.  That reporting can take place in a heads-up display within Rhino, as well as in an Excel dashboard.  This client facing Excel dashboard could be pre-populated with program targets and development metrics to evaluate relative success of the proposals.  Typical use case: Small-medium scale planning where forms are irregular and design is a priority. Scenario Builder allows users to develop programming scenarios within an Excel dashboard and then have masses automatically generated in Rhino that represent program targets.  Those masses can be categorized by use and their proportions constrained to pre-determined building footprints sizes or ratios.  After manual manipulation of the masses, Mass Reporter can report program yields and planning metrics back into a client-facing dashboard for comparison against program targets. Typical use case: A range of planning scales with minimal variation in building typology.  Program variation and basic site capacity is a priority. City Builder allows users to model whole urban environments with grasshopper scripts from a single-line street network, drawn in either CAD or Rhino.  Right-of-Way widths, curbs, setbacks, building footprint and other information can get generated from grasshopper scripts. New typologies and modifications to boilerplate script elements can easily be generated within Grasshopper to make the environment project specific.  Using Mass Reporter, program yields and planning metrics can then be reported to client-facing dashboard. Typical use case: Large scale planning where rule-based modeling and overall program tracking are a priority. WHAT’S NEXT FOR MASS METRICS? We would love for you to show us! Our practice is continually evolving and our tools need to do the same.  If toolsets in Mass Metrics 2.0 doesn’t support your specific project please reach out to the development team (Mike Aziz, Brad Rogers, and Andrew Salveson).  The development team is here to assist and advise project teams on how we can improve on these toolsets. Most importantly, there is now a P+W repository for all those improvements.  So, as quickly as they are made, they can be shared. WHAT’S IN THE MASS METRICS STARTER PACK? Mass Metrics User Guide Required Grasshopper plugins 2. Rhino and Excel Templates 3. Layer Naming Manual 5. Links to Sample Videos General Notes: 1. Mass Metrics was developed to improve our planning work in the broadest sense.  The sample files were developed as templates, and customization will be required.  The Mass Metrics development team can assist and advise on customization during project start-up.  A “scoping call” is recommended before implementation to discuss any changes. 2. Use of Mass Metrics requires adherence to standard layer naming conventions.  See more information in the Mass Metrics layer manual for details. 3. If improvements to the scripts or dashboard were made during the project, please upload your files back to the Digital Tools resource center so that we can share your improvements in later editions of Mass Metrics. Installation Instructions You will have to install all of the plugins included in the INSTALL – plugins linked folder. If you have questions about how to do this, contact your local DA person. Usage · If you are using the sample Rhino file (TEMPLATE.3dm) there should be no problems with the script. · If you start from scratch you have to first check the unit system of Rhino. Work in the correct unit system. (VERY IMPORTANT!) Work with meters or feet. · Try to create centrelines as continuous as possible. If they follow each other just join them. It increases the performance of the script and also makes it work. Try to avoid small centrelines. · Make sure centrelines don’t extend after hitting one another. Also make sure centrelines touch to prevent funny geometry. · For correct calculations, Phase and Use zones should not intersect with other Phase or Use zones; for instance, Phase 01 polyline should not collide with Phase 02 polyline. · Don’t have extra phase layers and polylines within these layers otherwise all of the calculations will be incorrect. · Don’t try to work on two different areas which are not combined in one Rhino file. If you have to use the script for another area, it is recommended to have it on another Rhino file and reuse the script. · Provide your site boundary to the Centreline_0 Layer (NOTE: this is currently broken somewhat) · You can create as many centrelines as possible in the same format, providing the street width after the underscore. For instance if you want the centreline to be 20m wide, the layer name which contains these objects should be named as: Centreline_20 You can colour the layers in the way you want, however for the Grasshopper script to see any newly created layers you must toggle the “auto-update” boolean at the top left on and then off again. · You can create as many phase layers and objects as you want with only one closed polyline within. Name the layers with this in this format. Phase 01, Phase 02, etc. Just be sure that they don’t overlap. Furthermore, don’t create empty ones. · For the Use Zones you don’t have a limit of layers you can create as many layers as you want even if they are empty. Whenever you create a polyline within these layers script will allocate the blocks within to these functions and show you the total areas on your screen. · If you want to write the numbers to a spreadsheet, open one excel file and click on the button in the Grasshopper script called ‘WRITE TO EXCEL’ Version History 2.2 Improvements to Mass Reporter and City Builder based on project use feedback. 2.1 New Mass Reporter script with in-Rhino heads up display and improved functionality MassReporter now Script-based, EXE program installation no longer required (still linked through the _ARCHIVE folder) Renamed CityBuilder and ScnearioBuilder files, easier to find in folder structure Automated C+S Base Plan reporting built into Mass Metrics Excel 2.0 Introduction to CityBuilder, MassReporter, and ScenarioBuilder",

    "content": "After publishing some Revit tool articles in previous newsletters we received positive feedback and many inquiries about available Revit productivity tools, and we continue talking about better Revit workflows using the tools we already have. Today Jeff Ziemann (DTL in NYO) shares improved project workflows using the new tool – Room Data Sheets (CTC Revit Express tools) and a well- known tool BIMLink (Ideate Software): After completing the first phase of a 25-story ambulatory care center in NYC, the team wanted to take a step back and think about how we could be more efficient in the second phase planning stages of the project, using tools available to us in Revit. There are two tools/workflows that we intend to use going forward in order to streamline planning and preparation for end user meetings. · One is using BIMLink (or Spreadsheet link ) and existing room schedule templates to integrate user-generated program lists into Revit test fit plans. This workflow is already used across the firm in many projects. · The other is using the new CTC tool Room Data Sheets – a brand new tool which was rolled out with the latest update of CTC tools. It allows a utomate the tedious and time consuming task of creating consistent documentation for each room including plans, elevations, 3D views and schedules of finishes, fixtures, equipment and furniture. It even adds a filter to your schedules to filter information by room! https://ctcexpresstools.com/product/bim-project-suite-2017/#roomDataSheet In the early stages of the project, we generated program lists for 7 different departments, each with varying specialty rooms and requirements. Keeping these requests in line with the initial layouts became cumbersome because of the variety and quantity involved. In order to add another layer of organization, we wanted to use a workflow that keeps the program in check within Revit as the layouts developed from blocking plans to more realistic plans. Within the NYO project template is a schedule called “Program – Room Variances” . It’s a handy schedule for planning, as it allows you to compare the actual area of drawn rooms, to “target areas,” and highlights rooms that are outside of the boundary of the allowed variance from the target (You can insert PROGRAM – Room Program Area Deltas schedule into your project from BIMList firm wide library). We used BIMLink , to maximize the effectiveness of this schedule, by exporting the schedule as a base, and then using excel to transition department programs into a format that will import all the desired rooms and areas into the Revit project. When re-imported back to Revit, all the required rooms will now exist in the project, ready to be placed. (Note: you can also use CTC Spreadsheet Link tool . The difference is it will not import automatically, you will need to trigger manual import ). Once placed within the test-fits, we can reference the “Room Variances” schedule to confirm which rooms are missing, and which are overly generous or undersized, all in a single schedule. This saves the time of having to check back to the various excel program lists constantly, and keeps the test fits honest. It’s a method of making sure we are truly including all the users’ requests and highlighting where we are compromising. As the team got further into the process and began laying out individual rooms, we ended up developing over 100 enlarged plans and corresponding elevations for use in end-user meetings, and eventually documentation. This became quite time consuming for the sheer volume we had to produce. For Phase 2, we intend to use the Room Data Sheets (RDS) CTC tool to expedite this process. After some exploration into this, the new tool is highly effective in generating all the desired views for a room data sheet (plans, elevations, ceilings, axons, schedules) with a few simple clicks. Once you set up the desired options for the view development, you can easily apply this to dozens of rooms to create many views and sheets very quickly. Without the tool, this process requires calling out the plan, calling out the ceiling plan, picking each elevation individually, and then picking your schedule. All this is done at once with this tool, and it should greatly increase the efficiency of the next phase of our project. Jeff has authored a MicroKnowledge card about how to use Room Data Sheets tool which you can fine here: https://mk.perkinswill.com/ Links to previous Revit tool articles: https://pulse.perkinswill.com/content/92872 https://pulse.perkinswill.com/content/92868 https://pulse.perkinswill.com/content/87071",

    "content": "Dynamo is a visual scripting platform that extends Revit’s functionality, enabling you to perform operations that are unavailable in the standard interface or automate repetitive tasks. It has been available as an add-in to Revit since version 2015, but 2017 includes an additional feature called Dynamo Player, which allows you to run Dynamo scripts at the push of a button, without needing to open the Dynamo authoring environment. Dynamo and Dynamo Player are both accessed through the ‘Manage’ tab in Revit 2017. Dynamo Player simply provides a list of all Dynamo scripts that are stored in a particular directory. The library of P+W Dynamo scripts can be found at: S:\\_Firmwide\\Dynamo\\DynamoPlayerScripts\\. To change the directory Dynamo Player is accessing press the ‘folder’ button in the upper left hand corner of the Dynamo Player window. To run a script press the ‘play’ button to the left of that script. If custom inputs are required to run the script a separate window will pop up asking for additional information. (Note to developers: Use the ‘Data Shapes’ package to create these custom input windows.) To edit a script press the ‘pencil’ icon to the right of the script. Doing so will open that script in the Dynamo authoring environment. If you have an idea for a script that you would like to see developed and deployed to the Dynamo Player library submit your request via the HackStack custom tools request form here: https://dp.perkinswill.com/hackstack/ . All requests are discussed and vetted for development on the bi-weekly Custom Tools call led by Iffat Mai , 12-1 Eastern the 2nd and 4th Tuesdays of the month. If you’re pretty handy with Dynamo and want to develop scripts reach out to Luc Deckinga , P+W’s Digital Practice Manager for Computational Design.",

    "content": "In search of the best combination of quality, workflow and scope Senior Project Designer in Atlanta, Randy Maxwell chose to explore IrisVR Prospect following his use of Enscape, Lumion and Kubity. An avid technologist Randy made a personal purchase of the newest Oculus Rift including the additional Touch controllers to use alongside the Atlanta office’s HTC Vive. On two separate occasions, Randy presented virtual reality to the client, Saint Jude Children’s Hospital.  The first presentation paired Prospect with the HTC Vive/Steam.  Later, Randy brought the new Oculus Rift to use with Prospect during the second presentation.  Prospect recognized the Touch controllers as Vive controllers which prevented their use, but did not lessen the experience for the clients. Both presentations were very successful and generated excitement in the client.  After their experience with the VR presentations, they felt more engaged and better able to understand the design and scale of their projects, having fun in the process. Workflow The original geometry in Revit was exported to SketchUp 2017 where the foliage and tree maker plugin, 3DArcStudio was used to add vegetation.  The SketchUp file used for the presentation was 160 MB, 7 million triangle and 4 million faces.  The processing time for Prospect was two minutes and with the ability to save a ready-to-present file to a local hard drive.  This critically important feature allows for the VR presentation to be opened without an Internet connection. VR Hardware Preference Randy prefers the Oculus Rift over the HTC Vive.  During the course of the project the Oculus Rift proved to have two compelling advantages. First, it took less time and was more straight-forward to setup than the Vive.  The Vive’s larger ‘VR Room’(16 feet diagonally) requires more physical room and its sensors and stand take more time to set up.  Randy notes he has never witnessed anyone’s movement exceed more than a few step in any direction.  The smaller VR room of the Oculus Rift is sufficient and its small compact sensors are quick to set up. Travel with the Oculus Rift is easier as well.  When flying all of the Oculus Rift equipment fits in a carryon.  Since the Vive equipment needs stands for the sensors it has to be checked. Another difference between the two is the weight of the headset.  Randy found the Vive headset to be heavier and more cumbersome.  Although both the Vive and Oculus Rift headsets require a tethered connection to a computer the lighter weight of the Oculus headset made it more comfortable. Randy could not discern a notable difference in resolution between the headsets, but did find the Oculus Rift’s environment to be a bit brighter. Software Comparisons In his efforts to create VR Randy has used Prospect, Enscape, Lumion and Kubity.  Enscape and Prospect can process both Revit and SketchUp.  Prospect provides free accounts with some limitations. Kubity works primarily with Sketchup and the VR is in beta. It looks like it has potential. Randy finds the real-time rendering of Enscape interesting, but the resolution of its VR environment subpar.  Enscape has very nice atmospheric editing that can be reflected in its VR environment.  Like Enscape, Lumion provides real-time rendering.  Although it creates 360-degree panoramas, it does not have true VR capability. Lessons Learned Randy’s biggest lesson learn is not to heighten the client’s expectations and promise them a VR presentation in the first place.  Plan to use VR as an added surprise and enhancement.  This is such new technology and so many things can go wrong.  Randy notes some of his co-workers whose presentation went badly when an Internet connection could not be establish on location.  He also points out that not all spaces can accommodate larger VR rooms.  Before the client experiences the VR environment, be sure to communicate the VR presentation is representational, and not real or photorealistic. Processing Statistics for Prospect Below Randy provides his latest tests using SketchUp files of the Saint Jude Children’s Hospital project at varying levels of detail. SU/Prospect Test 1 161 MB, 7 million triangulations, 2 minutes to process SU/Prospect Test 2 171 MB, 23 million triangulations, approximately one hour to process SU/Prospect Test 3 179 MB, 38 million triangulations, approximately one hour to process, but did not always process successfully",

    "content": "Chicago recently had the opportunity to test the Hololens during a master planning competition, focusing heavily on the hardware’s application to the design and concept phase of project delivery. The learning curve for development was initially a bit difficult, as developing for the Hololens requires working with and publishing models through Unity. Having never used Unity before and having little experience with writing scripts I reached out to Simon Chavez in the Seattle office to help get started.  After working together for two weeks on and off I was able to get a functional understanding of how the software works to write and develop for the hardware. Initially it showed promise, having the ability to effectively produce a “physical” model with a few clicks was a quick way to get a better feel for the composition of the master plan we were developing. It quickly became apparent shortly after getting the process to work that there were three big drawbacks to the hardware… 1.)  Isolating the Experience 2.)  Little Interest after Initial Impact 3.)  Comfort of Use Isolation: While exciting to experience a new technology, we found that the Hololens makes engagement very unrewarding to those not seeing the project through the headset. Our first impression was that it would make the design more immersive both for internal design development and for design delivery. As we used it through the course of the project it became clear that the lack of tools within the model viewer was one of the biggest drawbacks. We were able to program the ability to scale, move, and rotate the model through verbal and hand gestures, but in the end we found that it became more of a gimmick when compared to the other presentation materials developed. Initial Impact: After the initial impression of trying the Hololens or the fanfare of seeing a co-worker wearing the hardware we found that interest quickly dropped off. People would differ to simply asking how it looks as opposed to trying it on for themselves. Internally you could see rooms light up when someone was playing with the device, but after everyone had a go, there would be very little interest or follow-up after having tried the hardware. Comfort of Use: This wasn’t necessarily a revelation after having used the Samsung Gear in numerous client meetings already, but as with that headset, clients can be very apprehensive when it comes to wearing the hardware. This made larger scale engagement difficult, as the headset was also viewed with a degree of stigma in our actual client meeting. And as mentioned above, the isolation of the experience made conveying the concepts too difficult to integrate into the presentation itself, making it more of an add-on after the Q+A. Additionally the commands and interface are hard to get comfortable with so most first time users find it intimidating and quickly take it off after trying it on for a few seconds. The current state of the Hololens makes its integration with our design process both difficult and distracting. For what we got out of it in our client interactions it feels like a tool that you bring out to “Wow” a client for the purposes of winning a project, but then shelving it once the project is won. For the Holoens to make sense as a design tool I think a few features would need to be implemented in the devloper build kit to make it more useful. First would be the ability to design within the software on the Hololens. Ideally having the ability to generate shapes or place pre built objects would be a great feature. If it were possible to actually generate, or at the very least manipulate a scheme and then export it back into a software such as Rhino, I would have found much more value in the peripheral from a design perspective. Even giving it a real time link up in the way Enscape or Lumions Live Sync work with another modeling software would be a step in the right direction. The second feature that would bring some merit without dramatically overhauling how the software currently works would be the ability to generate new views. Features like a section box would allow for the design to be observed on more than just an aesthetic level. The ability to examine the building closer in section in ways that could be actively manipulated would bring attention to design critiques that could be translated during the design process. This could also make the Hololens more integral in client interactions because the depth and complexity of the model can quickly be translated beyond drawings in a visual manner for the client to quickly understand, taking out the need for the client to internally visualize a conversation. Making it possible to stream line the communication and reduce the possibility of things being lost in translation during design review and coordination meetings would further immerse users in a Minority Report style enviornment that many have the expectation of experiencing before even trying the Hololens. A similar method could also be useful if given the ability to place perspective cameras into the model to generate stereo panoramic views in real time, the same way that the Gear VR is used. Giving the client the ability to place a person akin to Google Maps street view anywhere in the model and having it properly scale would make the design more relatable and the tool more valuable. Generally I’m glad to have had the opportunity to work with the Hololens. While I am disappointed in the current state of the hardware it is important to keep in mind that this is still being developed for and the future will undoubtedly hold vast improvments to the way we read and write for the Hololens. It’s just a question of how long it takes to get there.",

    "content": "VR PROJECT STORY DEVELOPMENT GUIDE FOR A SUCCESSFUL PRESENTATION A VR PROJECT PROCESS FOR STORY AND PRESENTATION ADAPTED FROM IRIS VR ARTICLE ON STORY AND PRESENTATION IN VR Project teams have the desire to now make the best of VR for help in conveying their specific story and process for the design of the client’s building, product, or plan.  The hardware and technology make this possible.  But how to use the hardware and software in a manner reminiscent to the craft of storytelling remains an allusive practice that can do the most in the least amount of time and effort.  Please consider the following questions in defining the story that VR should convey. WHAT WILL BE THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE FOR THE PRESENTATION THAT WILL USE SOME ASPECT OF VR? ARE THERE ANY KEY EXTERIOR OR INTERIOR SPATIAL THEMES THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO THE PROJECT? DID THE PROJECT TEAM USE AN INNOVATIVE PROCESS, PARTI, BIG IDEA, OR CONCEPTUAL GESTURE? We now have a good understanding of the parti and process for why this is a great project. WHAT WERE THE SERIES OF DECISIONS MADE BY THE TEAM TO DEVELOP THE PROJECT DESIGN? HOW DID THESE SET OF CHOICES OR THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS BEST REPRESENT THE CLIENT’S ORIGINAL REQUEST FOR DESIGN SERVICES? We now have the steps that reinforce the project process that elaborates the decision-making narrative which is why the project team answered the client’s initial question with the project proposal. CONSIDER THE USE OF VR AS AN AID IN A MORE PERSONAL OR FIRST-PERSON EXPERIENCE THAT MOVES THROUGH THE CENTRAL MOMENTS THAT SHAPE THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS, PARTI, AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROJECT. REFINE THE CRITICAL DECISION MAKING MOMENTS OF THE PROJECT DESIGN  TO 5 AND NO MORE THAN 10 STEPS ALONG THE PROCESS OF THE PROJECT WORK. CONSIDER THE AVAILABLE DIGITAL PROJECT MODEL AND MATERIALS FOR THE KEY DECISION-MAKING MOMENTS. IT MAY NOT BE NECESSARY THAT THE MODELS AND MATERIALS DEVELOP TO A PARTICULAR LEVEL OF FINISH. In the next article, we can discuss the various levels of software and hardware for development of the digital story in VR and if the project story and process is appropriate for this medium.",

    "content": "VR Pilot Using Stingray with Autodesk Consulting The Atlanta Dairies Project Team and Digital Practice recently finished piloting Stingray with assistance from Autodesk Consulting. Autodesk’s Stingray is a gaming engine for creating real-time design visualizations and virtual reality experiences. As an Autodesk product, Stingray benefits from integration and workflows with other Autodesk products. Exploring these workflows and benefits was one of the key objectives of the project. Thank you to Justin Cooper, Steve Summerford and Allen Post of the Atlanta Dairies project team for their participation in this pilot. Project Description The Atlanta Dairies consists of 40,000 sf retail & entertainment space surrounding a 17,000 sf or 0.4 acre courtyard, featuring dozens species of plants and trees. The courtyards were the primary focus of the presentation. In particular representing the range of vegetation realistically and as recognizable species was a high priority. The Outcome The completed VR scene was console-driven as a standalone executable on a Windows computer. Due to the vegetation’s level of detail and quantity, the Vive headset was unable to maintain a rate of 90 frames per second. Reducing the vegetation’s detail or dividing the scene up would allow the Vive to maintain the 90 fps. Quickly swapping the vegetation for less detail was counter to the presentation’s purpose. Unfortunately, dividing the scene up required labor beyond our available time. Even so, the project was successful at helping us to understand Stingray’s capabilities, limitations and workflow. Why Consider Stingray? It may be the most viable option for designers and teams looking to utilize VR with varying degrees of commitment and skill. Three features adding to this are an integrated workflow, access to material shaders and visual scripting. Integrated Workflow – Many game engines familiar to the AEC industry require workflows developed for the game industry. A big reason these workflows are different, is the VR scene is the end product for game companies. Stingray’s workflow should feel familiar to those in our industry. It integrates with Revit through a one-click cloud service called Autodesk Live. This service optimizes the geometry, maintains BIM information and converts Autodesk materials to standard materials that all game engines need. After automatically downloading, the resulting file can be explored as-is in a real-time environment using Live. If the file is opened in Stingray, minimal effort is needed to advance it to a true VR scene for use with the Vive or Occulus Rift. Those willing to expand their skills a little may apply pre-created enhancements of various kinds. Access to Material Shaders – Another application is not required to change materials. The modifying, swapping and creating of materials can occur within Stingray. This includes animated materials such as fire and water, which where both used in the Atlanta Dairies project. Materials can also be saved and shared between Stingray VR scenes. Visual Scripting – This user-friendly feature allows those without programming knowledge to add interactivity to VR scenes. Blocks of logic called flow nodes can be wired together to author experiences for our clients.  A few common examples would be doors opening and moving furniture or other ojects within the scene. If you prefer text-based scripting instead Stingray uses the Lau Language. The Lua scripting language is known for being lightweight and fast.  It is a great choice for beginners and advanced scripters.  Both Lau scripts and the visual scripts can be saved an reused on future projects. Hardware Requirements Like other game engine providers, Autodesk’s official hardware requirements are the minimal required to run the application, not an immersive VR experience. To develop and deliver VR for architecture and interior design projects Digital Practice recommends a Core i7 at 2.6GHz or higher, 32-48 GB of RAM and an nVidia 980Ti, GTX 1070 or GTX 1080 graphics card. Stingray, like other gaming engine software will not run on Perkins+Will’s standard production nodes. VR Equipment Compatibility Both the Vive and Occulus Rift are compatible with Stingray as well as Gear VR and Google Cardboard. Autodesk is developing compatibility for the Hololens.",

    "content": "NGPG BUFORD CLINIC MODULE WORKSHOP NORTHEAST GEORGIA HOSPITAL SYSTEM A VR EXPERIENCE WITH NGHS CLIENT BY KATIE ANDERSON and DAMIEN LINNEN, ATLANTA OFFICE Northeast Georgia Hospital System – NGPG Buford Clinic Module Workshop Our team has been working with the Northeast Georgia Hospital System to develop a clinic module standard, implemented first at a new 60,000 square foot facility in Buford, Georgia, but designed for future renovation and new projects. During our most recent workshop, we utilized the VR system to help the client understand space and sight lines within the team work core, which they had previously had difficulty with understanding and imagining possibilities through diagrams and drawings alone. One of the objectives of the workshop was to evaluate the differences between a six exam room and a 12 exam room clinic module. We had previously held meetings showing diagrams of module options but had been unable to reach a firm consensus. Using the VR system, they were able to quickly determine that a 12 exam room module was too deep and would lead to undesirable travel distances for clinical staff and patients. We were also able to demonstrate that the six exam room configuration allows for greater penetration of daylighting into the teamwork core, which was a desirable feature. Additionally, they were able to experience multiple configurations of on-stage off-stage work environments for the staff, which helped them solidify their decision. 6 Exam Room Module Repeated 12 Exam Room Module 6 Exam Room Module: Staff Work 12 Exam Room Module: Staff Work In a previous experience, the client with another architectural firm and their Lean consultant had built a “cardboard city” of their clinic design, which cost more than $80,000. The client team reported to us that it was a lot of money, a lot of effort and that they didn’t get the desired results from the exercise. After our meeting, we received many compliments from the client about the work we had done, including how powerful the VR experience had been for them. One member of the client team said: “here comes P+W with this virtual reality approach that would have saved all of that money!” One member of the client team said: “here comes P+W with this virtual reality approach that would have saved all of that money!” Perkins+Will, Genesis and Client Team We set up a projector to display the view from the VR headset onto the wall outside the conference room so that multiple people could watch while one wore the headset. Perkins+Will Damien Linnen with Client Representative in a Full VR Environment Multiple client team members tried the headset and helped to quickly reach a decision on the direction to proceed with the design of the clinic module.",

    "content": "Last month we have rolled out an upgrade for CTC Tools in Revit. This upgrade not only improves the tools we already had (some of them are teams’ favorites), but also introduces  new productivity tools for project teams and model managers. All these tools  can be found under Revit Express Tools tab in Revit.  Each tool has a link  to YouTube video. . Note: YouTube Videos may not play on the node – copy and paste the link to your laptop browser. If you have additional questions, ask you DA or contact CTC support. You can email support@ctcexpresstools.com or call toll free: 866-941-1181 Local: 952-941-1181. Following is a brief overview of most popular productivity tools currently available to PW users. CTC BIM Project Suite: BIM Project Suite Is a collection of very useful and widely used in PW tools. Some PW favorites in this group are: BIM List Browser Must know Gives you an access to PW content libraries. More info can be found here: BIM LIst 101 For Users Quick Select Selects elements by filtering specific categories or parameter values. Search elements that match filter criteria can either be added to, removed from or replace the currently selected items. Renumbering Provides a fast and simple way to renumber your rooms and doors . Auto-swapping avoids duplicates. Alphanumeric sequential numbering. Add separators and suffices to room and door numbers. Revision Manager Lists revision information, including view and sheet associations, and allows the results to be saved to a spreadsheet file. Identify which parts of a model were affected by a revision. Validate that revision best practices are being followed. Use together with Revit Cloud Remover from BIM manager Suite Room Data Sheets New! Generates 3D, Plan, Reflected Ceiling, Elevation, Schedule and Legend views. Controls naming, order, placement and presentation of views on sheetsPreview sheets to be created and adjust spacing, size and scaleManaging hundreds of sheets containing room and space data throughout the projectSave and load settings of previous configurations. This tool in new and can potentially save teams a lot of time. Give it a try! Room Family Manager Unsung hero Room Family Manager enables defining, maintaining, and validating the family content of each room type definitions.Build room type definitions in a spreadsheetBuild room type definitions from existing Revit roomsAutomatically place family content in your model based on room type assignmentsValidate that rooms in your model contain required families Especially efficient when used together with Room Data Sheets! Schedule XL Available to all PW users now Creates Schedule View or a Drafting view from Spreadsheet Data so the data from sources outside of Revit can be included on sheets and printiedCan create schedule views from one or more worksheets in one or more spreadsheets.Can update the schedule views when the original spreadsheet has changed.Can be configured to automatically update when the Revit project is opened if the original spreadsheet has changed – be careful with your settings. Spreadsheet Link Popular in PW Facilitates Bi-Directional Spreadsheet Linking. Exports data (including type and/or  instance parameters) from Revit elements to a spreadsheet where the data can be edited and then imported and applied back in to the Revit model. Can also be used to create new unplaced rooms, spaces, areas, zones and sheets. CTC BIM Manager Suite: BIM manager suite  tools are intended to be used for model and content maintenance. The new tool in this Suite is Family Checker . However PW has other and perhaps more useful tool available for this purpose. More Info here Library analysis tool (content analyzer) Some of PW favorites in this group are: Project Cleaner Deletes views, sheets and Revit Links.Useful for preparing models for consultants and or to lighten consultants models  before linking them into your projects.Note: Etransmit has similar functionality but less configurable. Revit Cloud Remover This tool makes it fast and easy to remove non-issued revision clouds from your project. use together with Revision Manager from BIM Project suite. Dimension Checker Identifies dimension strings which are using the dimension override options and presents for review. Additional filter options can be used to narrow the search results Family Processor Content maintenance favorite! Allows  to define one or multiple changes to one or more Revit family files, and then process those changes in batch. Can audit families, batch upgrade  and compact them and do many other tricks with parameters and materials. CTC SuperDoor Configurator : SuperDoor includes content (Revit families) for building a nearly infinite variety of doors, and software which provides a graphical wizard interface that guides Revit users through selecting/configuring door components and then placing them into their Revit project. PW uses our own content on CTC software platform. It includes curtain wall doors, wall-hosted doors with size by instance, and wall-hosted doors with size by type. They are color coded. CTC BIM Batch Suite: New Suite of tools . Family Exporter Use to extract families before file purging, for archival and to harvest loadable families from projects. Family Loader Configurable, can be used to  batch load previously archived families in case of file corruption. Project and Family Upgrader This tool is avable in PW for evaluation and testing. Currently we use Etransmit. Note: revit files need to be audited and cleaned up prior to upgrade",

There is also an option to submit a request for assistance in finding/creating Revit content. DA Assistance creates a helpdesk ticket which will be assigned to your office DAM . The tool automatically collects data from currently open document: name and location, size, version, workset info, active view name, etc.  You just  just need to describe the problem. Content Assistance creates a special helpdesk ticket which will be visible to all DAMs through helpdesk and a dedicated slack channel. Additionally, your office DAM will be notified in his/her own slack channel. This will minimise duplication of efforts and promote collaboration in content creation. Additionally each of these tools has live links to useful self-help and learning resources.

    "content": "“The future is already here – it’s just not very evenly distributed” – William Gibson In an attempt to identify individuals with experience using Computational Design tools, specifically two common visual scripting platforms, Grasshopper and Dynamo, the Digital Practice team conducted a survey of people in all Perkins+Will offices who had expressed interest in computational design. Some of our findings are shown below. If you would like to be included in our findings you can take the survey here . # of Respondents: 133 # of Offices Represented: 18 # of Grasshopper Users and Experience per Office (Darker Color = More Experience) # of Dynamo Users and Experience per Office (Darker Color = More Experience) What are we trying to do? Our goal is to support the network of computational designers throughout the firm and create a framework in which the effort and knowledge of a single person can benefit everyone in the firm, regardless of their location. Additionally, we want knowledge of how to execute a computational workflow to be exchanged between offices as readily as the work created from it. In many ways Perkins+Will operates as a network of individual offices rather than as a monolithic entity. Using this structure as a strength, we leverage people’s unique insights into their local markets and react nimbly to local conditions. Unfortunately, this distribution also presents challenges to efficiently collaborating and sharing resources between offices. Even within a single office, one studio or practice area may not be aware of the work being done by others. By their nature, computational design processes must be well-defined and, once created, a script may be used by many people. The barrier to sharing this work isn’t technological, but rather a lack of communication, both within and between offices. We want resources and knowledge to have value beyond the silo of their creation and to have positive effects throughout the firm. How does the information from this survey help us? The information we collected in the computational design survey gives us a strategy to support the use of computational tools in every Perkins+Will office. From the data collected we have a picture of who at Perkins+Will have experience with or interest in visual scripting tools, as well as where those tools reside. Applying the economic metaphor of supply and demand, each office can be thought of as a market. The graphs above illustrate the supply of computational knowledge that exists in each office. The demand is the degree to which design leadership wants to use computational tools on their projects. Offices, studios, and practice areas that want to leverage computational design can now see if they have resources in their location to undertake those tasks themselves. If the supply doesn’t meet the demand within an office they need to either develop those skills or reach out to the firm-wide computational design network for support. For offices where these skills are insufficient, there are two solutions: we can train designers to be proficient, or we can use existing talent in another office. Ideally both are used in combination. To build skills, designers are first trained to use computational design tools through online courses, followed by in-person workshops. Eventually designers are paired with a mentor, a more experienced computational designer, on a project. It is the mentor’s role to guide development efforts and get the less experienced designers over the hurdles they will encounter. One of the most difficult aspects of learning computational tools is getting stuck trying to debug errors during the initial learning curve, which can be steep. Having a mentor to steer the designer around obstacles helps alleviate this roadblock. The goal is for the designer to be self-sufficient by the end of the project and for them to operate autonomously on their next computational task. If an appropriate mentor exists within the office they can help to bring up the proficiency of those around them; if not, a computational designer from another office can be brought in to temporarily fill the skills gap until local staff are independently capable.Knowledge has momentum. Offices that have a critical mass of computational design knowledge are able to support and mentor other interested individuals and to execute computational workflows on local projects. Design leaders quickly recognize the power of computational workflows once they are exposed to them through projects in their office. One successful project inevitably leads to other projects looking to replicate and build upon that success. We must both support designers’ skill development and bring awareness of their value to those who direct projects. How are we supporting these efforts? There is a Slack team for designers to communicate with one another regardless of location, so they can support and learn from each other. Join the conversation at PWcomputationalDesign.slack.com/signup Join the bi-weekly call the 1st and 3rd Thursdays of the month, where we feature projects using computational design and discuss the ever-evolving use of these tools within Perkins+Will. Contact Luc Deckinga , Digital Practice Manager for Computational Design to be added to the meeting invitation. 2-Day workshops training staff in Dynamo for Revit have begun. Contact your office Design Applications Manager for more information and let them know you would like to attend. Dynamo scripts created by designers across the firm that extend the functionality of Revit and automate repetitive tasks have been collected in a central location. They can be found here ( S:\\_Firmwide\\Dynamo\\DynamoPlayerScripts ) or accessed through the Dynamo Player in Revit 2017. We are currently developing a central repository of all computational scripts created by Perkins+Will designers. This catalog ( dp.perkinswill.com/catalog ) is currently in beta. Stay tuned for more information in a future Digital Practice newsletter.

    "content": "check out the map here! Every year Thornton Tomasetti hosts an AEC hackathon in New York to bring together technologically-minded AEC professionals. In a two day hackathon, teams prototype new technology and processes to advance the field. This year, the symposium and hackathon were attended by Anton Szilasi of Dallas, Saeran Vasanthakumar of Toronto, and Andrew Salveson of New York. Saeran and Andrew’s team, BEnMap – Building Energy Map Our won for the greatest potential impact. Project BEnMap – Building Energy Map Inspiration With federal- and state-level support for sustainability politically unlikely, the future of sustainable building will fall to the municipal level. Thankfully 15 major cities across the United States have passed legislation requiring reporting of building energy metrics. Boston is one of those cities. What we made We created a map to visualize various energy metrics for buildings within the city of Boston, including site and source EUI, greenhouse has intensity, EnergyStar score, and others, as well as calculated metrics such as the percent difference from 2030 targets. What it does The map filters and displays information about the buildings that have been reported by metric and by building type. A user can also look up a building by address. The aim is to inform people about how their cities and citizens are doing with respect to energy use: the map shows them who has reported and who hasn’t, as well as how those who have reported are doing. With the map a user can answer questions like, “Who are the highest producers of greenhouse gases in my city?” or “How green is the building I work in?” How we built it We had to clean data from the public repository listed at https://data.cityofboston.gov/ to more accurately represent buildings and ignore outliers. We filtered the data, matched it to building footprints by tax parcel ID, and added additional, novel metrics. What’s next for BEnMap We would love to add more cities, perhaps even a GIS server and database to keep track of the entire country! Built With OpenLayers Google Places API City of Boston Data P+W Participants Saeran Vasanthakumar (Toronto) Andrew Salveson (New York) AEC Hackathon 4.0 – San Francisco AEC Hackathon 4.0 was held in San Francisco January 6th through January 8th at the Microsoft Reactor Space in SOMA, San Francisco. Luc Deckinga and Andrew Salveson joined an engineer from Integral to create CaptainHook , a tool to help teams version control their files using Git. Traditional version control does not work for many project files because the differences between files are understood by the differencing algorithms. CaptainHook provides a way to send files to a custom differencing service, automatically adding difference reports to a project repository as a team works. The P+W team did not win the grand prize, but they did receive recognition for producing a tool that was actually complete and usable on Monday morning!

    "content": "In keeping with a long tradition of using innovative research and new technologies to advance both design and client experience, Perkins+Will DC office now offers virtual reality (VR) immersion to enhance client participation in the design process. The firm’s Collaborative Area for Virtual Exploration, or CAVE, enables use of state-of-the-art VR immersion tools in their design process so their clients now can more directly share the excitement, wonder and resolution of practical solutions as the design process unfolds. “CAVE makes it possible to communicate the complexity of shapes and forms that would not otherwise be apparent in 2D plans or elevations. Clients can be immersed early on as the built environment is being designed, and experience the space as if it is already completed,” says Tim Bakos, Principal and Director of Operations for the Washington, DC office. CAVE offers a simple, one-button click from the most commonly used design tools (Revit, Rhino or SketchUp, for example) to provide a wholly immersive design experience for the project team and their clients. As clients explore the evolving design process, Perkins+Will also builds a deeper level of stakeholder agreement earlier in the design process, when confirmed buy-in is so critical to schedule and budget management. “We can save our clients both time and money by eliminating the ambiguity or hesitancy that might come from an incomplete understanding of the proposed design. Ultimately, we can also improve satisfaction with the finished project,” says Bakos. Perkins+Will uses their CAVE to prove, or edit, important features of their designs, for example, confirming sight lines connect doctors to patients in a hospital project, or to remove blind spots from security in a public lobby. “We have photorealistically rendered immersive environments in different color and material palettes, too, so stakeholders can experience key features of the design – as we study them – so we can more convincingly earn their buy-in.” Once schematics are complete and construction documents are underway, Perkins+Will also uses virtual immersion to better detect cross-disciplinary conflicts. “It’s hard to miss a sprinkler or duct conflict with an architectural bulkhead when you’re staring right at it in virtual 3D space,” says Justin Benjamin, a Perkins+Will digital applications manager who sees this as an evolution of the more typical digital clash detection performed with Revit model files received from Perkins+Will engineering partners. “We haven’t had a single new user enter their own, process model without discovering something new about their work – at times running back to their desk to act on their findings right away.” In addition to enriching the design process at every phase, Perkins+Will plans to use the technology with commercial building clients to create virtual showrooms that will entice prospective tenants to lease vacant suites. Multiple personalized virtual versions of space can be created for marketing at a fraction of the cost of building a spec suite. Perkins+Will is also exploring the rapid delivery of virtual test-fits for brokers who are marketing turnover spaces, giving clients a leg up when trying to secure new anchor tenants. “It’s clear this tool is allowing our clients to experience evolving design ideas in a whole new way,” says Bakos. “And while we augment stakeholder engagement with this and other innovative technologies, we are improving the ROI for all parties.”",

    "content": "Last year several offices and project have tested Revizto for collaboration and visualization. Revizto is a collaboration and visualization software which integrates with multiple platforms: Revit, Navisworks ,AutoCAD, Civil 3D, SketchUp and ArchiCAD. It enables easy collaboration between all project stakeholders and allows effortless workflow from quite large Revit models directly to VR (Oculus and HTC Vive viewers). Revizto VR on Unilever project from PW Digital Practice on Vimeo .  Password is DAIt has several unique and useful features : Issue Tracker enables efficient team collaboration workflow with different levels of details for various stakeholders. It seamlessly connects team collaboration workspace with the various software platforms for production and management. 2D-3D integration allows jumping from sheets directly to 3D model Bi-directional integration with Navisworks and Revit for clash detection and resolution. After the project is uploaded to the Revizto cloud, it is immediately available to be viewed in VR – Oculus and HTC Vive viewers are included with install. NYO Unilever (PM- Danny Maghuyop, DTL – Phillip Leidy) team pioneered many features of Revizto on a large project. Following is some of their feedback: The overall  experience with Revizto has been positive. We have made good use of the visualization and were using some of issue tracker functions early on. Team Engagement We have had buy in on its use from the Architectural and MEP teams as it helped with visualizing locations and made finding routing for mechanical systems much easier. Structural was much less engaged though there can be a great value in having them be part of the coordination effort it Revizto. User Value In coordination meetings it was extremely easy to work through difficult or tight locations and find solutions when all the team members were together and looking at a live model. The rendering is simple and the model is reactive. It was also valuable on conference calls and we needed show the model or explain a location more thoroughly. Cutting a simple section and creating a quick visualization was its strong suit. While overall experience was positive and Unilever team recommended using the software on the next large NYO project, we did have some technical difficulties: In the middle of the year there were some issues with Revizto running on the nodes – this has been resolved in the new version which is installed and works without glitches on the nodes since September. Licensing schema was not flexible and license tracking was lacking details. Revizto team is working on better license tracking for next version, to be available in February.",

    "content": "On Tuesday January 31st we update our clarity software to the newest version.   This new version has plenty of small fixes and improvements.   You can see more information in the Clarity help section here .   The two primary features that you may be interested to use are; scripted tasks for Revit macros and Dynamo scripts, and the ability to create task sequences. If you’re not familiar with Dynamo yet, one of the main advantages of the new Dynamo Player in Revit 2017 is that you don’t need to know anything about visual scripting to take advantage of the process automations scripts that have been created by others, which can now be run by Clarity on a schedule basis.   The firmwide script library on our S drive is accessed through clarity for task setup.   We are constantly collecting new scripts and posting them there to further increase the ability of all projects to automate more day to day tasks.  With this new feature in Clarity you now have the option to run scripts manually in dynamo player (for Revit 2017) or schedule them through clarity .   In addition to dynamo scripts we can also use macros (which is like an addin without the button) which can be used in various ways; to save back to central (changing your file), to pre-process an operation on a detached model just for printing and export (similar to an old addin we had called NPLT) or to extract information to excel. Task sequences introduces the ability for you to put a bunch of tasks bundled together.   This makes sure that they will run in a certain order, which may become important as we introduce running macros and scripts on your model.   This is as simple as creating a task that allows you to select from all the other tasks you have in your project.   This will allow you to perform ‘pre-task’ items to your model with scripts or macros.   It will also allow you to bundle together regular weekly tasks, for example if you always need to publish PDFs, Dwgs and Models for the extended team.  The bundled tasks could also help to speed gains if they are all for the same model. If you are not currently using Clarity on your project please put in a ticket to get your project setup or contact your local design applications manager for more information.   You can also find more information about Clarity on our Pulse page .",

    "content": "Perkins+Will pursued and WON! healthcare work with a client we’ve never had before – UNC Rex Hospital. Since I was on the interview team and because were specifically put on the short list due to our VR work – we tried out a unique strategy in interviewing with the client. No use of PowerPoint I created a website that discussed ourselves and the project Includes RoundMe link for the client to view once the interview was over Includes team images / descriptions Showcases the design of the patient room / nurse stations Links to our perkinswill.com website The RoundMe page includes their existing hospital spaces and you can switch back and forth between the old and new. The group was very excited about their VR boxes and we assembled them in the interview and had them download the RoundMe app to their phone. We had backup iPads and Smart Phones in case, but everyone was willing to go through the process and there were no technological hiccups. Because we were not using a traditional PowerPoint presentation we were constantly interacting with the client group. The agenda broke down as such: Brief project introduction (Main webpage on display) Team introductions (Fun images, no corporate photos, we told our unique stories) Had the client team introduce themselves Had the client team discuss what they wanted in their renovated space. We essnetially treated the interview like a kickoff meeting – focusing on their project – not project history. Showed the existing hospital images in RoundMe, discussed what could be improved and adjusted. Had the client team open and assemble our PW branded VR boxes, installed RoundMe and directed them to the RoundMe page. Once they had enough time to play around with it, we walked through the RoundMe page on the projector We did end with a very quick PDF presentation of a similar healthcare space we rennovated. At the end there was further disucssion from the client team – question about the space, technical MEP issues, and challenges for the project. The interview lasted under 1-1/2 hour, which was our allotted time. There was no issues with technology and everyone was very open minded about the whole thing. There were no plans, elevations or P+W boilerplate imagery shown. We just found out recently that we won the project. Modeling was done in SketchUp, rendering in 3D Studio Max. https://rex.perkinswill.com/",

    "content": "The University of Washington’s Life Science Building was Seattle’s first project that utilized the Unity engine and Microsoft HoloLens. The design was viewed by the UW community in augmented reality, with an emphasis on the art wall designed by local artist Claude Zervais. We brought the Revit model into 3ds Max at over 13 million polys (not including the casework!) and the initial cleanup involved deleting all non visible assets and merging repeated assets such as windows and mulions. A few scripts were used to automate mesh cleanup and lower the poly count to a size that a game engine would be capable of rendering in real time. Simple UVW mapping followed, and materials and textures were applied inside of 3ds Max. materials applied in 3ds Max Due to the large size of the building, applying colliders was an important step. The quick and easy method is to import the FBX file into a game engine and click on the ‘generate colliders’ button, but this can slow down the game and make walking up or down stairs jittery. While still in 3ds Max, the building was separated into four layers: 1) Normal meshes, that can be simplified and don’t require collision. 2) High detail meshes that can’t be simplified and don’t require collision. 3) Meshes that can be simplified collision can be applied. 4) Meshes that are not visible in the game, but that the player could collide with. Using invisible objects, we could make ramps for the stairs so that the player could move up and down, without jittering. This project needed to be viewed in the Hololens. Unity is the only engine that has HoloLens support. The large user community and assets store were a big plus too. Each layer was exported as a separate FBX and imported into Unity with the correct settings applied to each layer. The model then required material clean-up and with the correct reflectivity settings and textures. Once materials had been applied, the exterior was populated with a mix of plants from the environment asset pack, and plants from the Unity Store. adding plants helped populate the space and bring it to life Unity cannot import IES lights, and due to the size of the scene, baking it in 3ds Max would’ve been next to impossible. Without lights, the interior lacked depth and dimension. Setting up a mix of self illuminating materials and point light, a lightbake was created for the entire building that took roughly a day. The lightbake had a huge impact on the space. lighting made the space more  defined Once lightbaking was complete, the only steps left were to simplify the scene, and to publish for both HoloLens and PC. Claude presented the artwall to the University of Washington’s students and faculty. A walk around of the building was projected for viewers to experience the space, and a separate station was available for the UW community to experience and see the artwall at full scale in the HoloLens.

    "content": "Recently the Digital Practice team set out to host an event that would be focused on outcomes and interaction rather than presentations. This event would effectively replace what had been an annual summit, in which all Design Application Managers were invited to attend. This smaller format made up of invitees was modeled on a workshop rather than a summit. The workshop was developed to have a three-fold purpose. The first is to communicate the current state of the Perkins+Will Digital Practice platform to its extended network of Design Application Managers & subject matter experts. The second, debate & decide what forces, internal and external are affecting Digital Practice at Perkins+Will, followed by how to counteract or accelerate those forces. The third and most important, to collaborate in person for the advancement of the core Digital Practice projects. Attendees of the smaller Digital Practice workshop are made up of Design Application Managers and Subject Matter Experts who are invited to be part of a four-person task force, focused on a Digital Practice project. Each task force is led by a Digital Practice manager and assembled several months in advance. Teams are challenged to create a set of goals and a series of objectives focused on a core area of the Digital Practice organization – Content, Data Centric Design Processes, Visualization including Virtual Reality, Computational Design and Continuing Education.The inaugural Digital Practice workshop took place in late October in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Six weeks prior to the workshop, teams assembled remotely to develop work plans and deliverables to support the projects goals. The actual face to face workshop was the opportunity for teams to roll up their sleeves and complete the work. Each team presented their work on the final day of the workshop. That work has been compiled into the following executive summary. Each team will also be sharing the outcomes on Pulse and face to face meetings throughout the firm. Based on the success of this inaugural workshop the Digital Practice is planning to hold 3 workshops in 2017. Below is the full summary, please read and offer any feedback.",

    "content": "Every year Autodesk holds a conference focused around new software offerings and updates facilitating more efficient workflows and training.  The emphasis of this conference is on expert training and feedback. This year, like many in the past, we had a strong group of Perkins+Will employees from across the firm.  We got the opportunity for all of us to meet face-to-face, enjoying each other’s company and exchanging ideas.  AU in general gave us a wide variety of learning opportunities and some good conversations between our own employees across the firm and other industry experts.  This year discussions branched out well beyond BIM as this is the present state of the industry. This encompassed many opportunities to try VR, discuss generative design, and see the latest in machine learning and aritficial intellegence.  Below is a recap of some specific bigger picture themes we took away from AU2016. Dynamo , a visual scripting tool which can connect to Revit is being adopted at lightning speed. There were many labs, classes and conversations about this tool and its use. If you are not familiar with it yet, you can find it in the addins tab of Revit 2016 or the manage tab of Revit 2017. It allows us to write scripts to tell the software to execute something even without knowing how to write any scripting language, this is called visual scripting. This will allow us to design better with Revit by executing complex operations that you might not be able to model by hand. It allows us to automate repetitive, mundane tasks freeing time to focus on the important things. It will allow more people to build tools for Revit that do standard project tasks. There were many classes that covered different ways to use this tool. We can utilise it for Computational Design (just like we can use grasshopper with Rhino). It can also be used to extract information, perform some file maintenance tasks and more. Two of those classes were given by some of our PW family that are experts in this realm; Josh Moore (DAM-Dallas) and Justin Benjamin (DAM-WashingtonDC) gave a talk on automating everyday tasks with dynamo and Jeremy Luebker (DAM-SanFransisco) and Luc Deckinga (Digital Practice Manager out of SF) gave a class on the workflows of moving geometry from SketchUp and Rhino into Revit using dynamo and other tools. Daqri Construction Helmet Many of us got the chance to try on the construction helmet which was available at the Daqri booth in the exhibitor hall.  This is a custom built device to bring spatially aware data to the construction working onsite.  It is Augmented Reality for work as opposed to the next Pokemon Go craze.  It is meant to map your surroundings and overlay specific information based on your location and the elements of the building you are looking at with systems or data of the final product.  This type of device is the bridge for us to deliver design intent to the contractors in the form of models instead of drawings. This device is similar to the HoloLens that we are currently testing in some our PW offices.   Generally speaking the experience with those is much more stable than this Daqri helmet which you could feel heating up your head after only 5-10 minutes.   Between the speed of the hardware of these devices and more limited range of view vs the HoloLens, we felt that these still had a ways to go before they will become mainstream and help contribute to a change in the process of delivery and consumption of design intent.   On the upside it is built on a Linux platform which is more open than the Windows platform of HoloLens. One other nice thing that they have already developed construction specific application –  a heat sensing camera and visualization app in order to see how much heat is flowing through a wall or pipe or other building elements. Password: DA Semi-autonomous_Mason from PW Digital Practice Robotics was very prominent on the exhibitor floor.   This starts to blur the lines between design and fabrication.   This also will impact our process as design intent modeling will more effortlessly transition to fabrication modeling which will drive these robots to create our designs.   A handful of us got to see this previously as we visited Branch Technology is Chattanooga, TN in October for a digital practice work session.   We have also been fortunate as a firm to be the only design focused business to utilzie Autodesk’s new Build Space .   In addition to these robotic arms that ‘print’ the design with different materials you can also see in the video above the automation of standard building construction leaving the specialist to focus on the unique parts of our design.   Although these robots are in their infancy when it comes to development you can already see the advantage of something that can work 24/7 and complete everything with precision per our specifications and design.",

    "content": "Managing details across multiple Revit models can be a time consuming chore in any Revit project. On a large project with distributed team and multiple models it can become a daunting task and takes many hours of coordination. To alleviate this challenge, Digital Practice in collaboration with Swedish First Hill project team has completed testing and piloting a new productivity tool for Revit – Detail Reference Utility (DRU) This tool enables teams to cross-reference views across multiple Revit models. For example, all details can be kept in a separate file(s) and called out from other models, and the reference labels will be automatically updated when details are moved to different sheets or their numbers are updated, similarly to how it works with details in the same model. In the pilot project the team was able to split out the details models and reduce the number of people working in each model at any given time from 12-16 to 5-8 people gaining productivity by reducing responce time. This effort was led by myself and Julie Adler from the project team side. Based on the team experience, we  can recommend  DRU for implementation on other large projects. If  you consider using the utility on your project, please reach out to your local Design Applications Manager. Here are some comments from the team: It is a great program to share details and organize them in sheets. Easy to use and easy to learn It worked just as it claimed to and updated automatically to follow sheet and detail number changes, once it was set up and linked properly. Liked that it logged everything so you could investigate all the updates by timestamp and user A great tool, especially for big projects with multiple Revit models Much faster to have the models split and split up the team, which wouldn’t have been possible without DRU Filtering of the details by model, sheet or detail number was very helpful The support was very responsive.  All issues were addressed quickly and responses were prompt. The workflow and interface seemed clear and consistent. No one found the tool difficult to use or to learn, and the process was pretty self-explanatory after training. it would be useful for large projects of any type, especially projects with multiple models and large teams.  The advantage of being able to set up separate detail models to reference from and have some team members working in the detail models while others work in the main models is a huge help in trying to keep the number of people in the models down, and it can’t easily be done without using DRU. I think the main factor in usefulness would be project size rather than type, market sector or phase. It is hard to say how many hours of coordination we would have saved, because we didn’t get far enough along in the project to begin to determine savings.  I would guess that it would be many, many hours, based on our previous experience with trying to use dummy tags and then having to have someone go back, check and edit all of the tags before each submittal. The only problem that users had was with graphics of the callout bubble – mostly because the expectation was that it behaves exactly like a live Revit callout. Since the testing, the developer had improved the bubbles. It should also be  noted that the utility has tools for diagnosing and repair of broken links – in a very controlled way. Here are some snapshot of the interface. For more details, watch this training video (48 min). Password is DA. DRU Training from PW Digital Practice on Vimeo .",

    "content": "Information for New Features for 2018 can be found here. While there are many new features in Revit 2017 below I have narrowed them to the ones of most interest for people transitioning to the newest version of our core software.   If considering upgrading an existing project additional caution is warranted this year.   First however the improvements. Depth Cueing Automagically showing depth with line weights Off On Facade recessions More railing hosts We can now sketch railings onto the top faces of floors, slabs, slab edges, walls, or roofs. Rebuilt text fuctionality In addition to the above new features there are many other items such as; dynamo player to run scripts without opening dynamo, more editing options in a perspective view, linking native rhino models, more functionality with global parameters which makes your project environment like the family editor, energy settings and further capabilites with Insight360, better connection to FormIT to improve workflow between products, removal of mental ray render engine now only including RT render engine like the cloud rendering service, adding formulas to tags, combining fields into one in schedules, improved point cloud capabilities, and many other small fixes and improvements which will help your daily workflows. CAUTION With a few of these new features there are some known bugs with upgrading models.   Please consult with your local DAM and run tests before upgrading a project.   Our recommendations are that projects heading toward issuing CDs or already in the construction phase should seriously consider whether they should stay with the current version or if there is a serious benefit with stabilitiy or new features that would warrant the upgrade to 2017.   Projects earlier on in the design process should just plan an upgrade into their project schedule at a convienent time and run test to see the consequnces of the change.   As always any project model upgrades should be part of a BIM Execution Plan and should be well coordinated with all our consultants and others impacted by the use of Revit models. The most important known issue is the movement of text as a result of the fundamental rebuild of the text tool in Revit.   This means the location of returns and layout of text dialog boxes on your sheet might not always be identical to what you saw in your 2016 or previous version models.   This includes text overlaps, word wrap changes, and text alignment issues in tags, marks and text elements.   All of these are really easy to fix but it will take time to review your sheets and find them as there is no way to automate this process.   We have already made the fixes to our firmwide standard content so moving forward any new projects will just enjoy the benefits of this new feature.   (see examples below) In addition to text issues there have been reported some problems with railings as a result of the new hosting features (see the link for text above for more info from Autodesk).",

Participants from Architecture firms and schools around the country gathered to learn a methodology and associated tools for formulating, executing, and communicating design spaces to support performance-based decisions. To see the final results created during this workshop or for more information about the building program and performance objectives visit the Design Space Construction challenge page: https://designspaceconstruction.org/portfolio-item/acadia-2016_workshop/ Design Space Construction – Defining, optimizing and communicating performace-based building design spaces Abstract: In day one, participants learned the methodology and associated tools for formulating, executing, and communicating a design space in support of performance-based decisions. Specifically they learn to: Formulate a design space, including Objectives, Alternatives, Impacts, and Value; Create a parametric model exploring building form and materials; Define energy, light, and view analysis; Explore a design space, including understanding importance and sensitivity of design parameters; Define a value equation, and optimize the building design; and, Report the results into an online database capable of storing and comparing design spaces. After a day of learning these methods, participants broke into teams and spent two days in a collaborative project constructing new and more challenging design spaces to meet the real world Perkins+Will challenge of designing a child care center. The Workflow: Six teams, consisting of 3 or 4 people per team, learned, used and expanded upon a multi-software workflow that includes Dynamo, Rhino/Grasshopper, Ladybug/Honeybee, EnergyPlus, Flux, GoogleDocs and a Parallel Coordinate Plot tool developed by Perkins+Will to visualize large data sets. This workflow is broken down into three major parts; Design of Alternatives, Performance Analyses, and Visualization and Optimization. Participants were only required to engage the first of these three parts by developing a parametric system to generate multiple Design Alternatives based on the permutations of all input variables. Each design was then run through the Performance Analyses provided with the workflow and the results visualized with the Parallel Coordinate Plot tool. Bonus: Space Plan Generator! Teams were also given the option to utilize the Space Plan Generator (SPG), a Dynamo tool developed by Subhajit Das in a collaboration between Autodesk, Perkins+Will and the Georgia Institute of Technology. SPG takes a building program spreadsheet and automatically arranges program elements within a defined site boundary and according to their adjacency desires. Alternatives generated by SPG are pushed into Grasshopper where they can be run through the existing Performance Analyses. Teams that chose not to use SPG developed their own parametric systems for creating Design Alternatives in either Dynamo or Grasshopper or some comibination of the two.

    "content": "This talk is focused on the intimate relationship between fabrication and form. For centuries, architects have appropriated the tools around them to bring their designs to fruition, but we have passed a remarkable milestone in which architects no longer need to rely on out-of-the-box software to fulfill their needs. Architects are now crafting new tools to accomplish new forms. The first aspect of this “tool-smithing” occurs when architects use visual programming to “hack” existing software packages like Rhinoceros and Revit. Rather than using code to break into the database of macros deep within each software package, user-friendly visual programming interfaces have emerged that allow users to string together primitive blocks into a bespoke command that accomplishes exactly what they want, or generates a solution beyond what they could have manually modeled. The second realm in which Architects are crafting their own tools is in bespoke robotics. This category encompasses both industrial robots and microcontrollers. Architects are approaching industrial robots with a different agenda compared to other industries. While other industries look to robots to automate a process, architects are asking how they can move fabrication forward to realize otherwise impossible forms and techniques. Industrial 6-axis robot arms are being used to weld, bend, stack, cast, and distort materials with digitally-derived precision. This is the differentiator between traditional uses of robotics and the exploratory nature of architects. Micro-controllers are small business-card-size computer chips with open-ended potential for writing custom commands. These small chips can be sent custom commands from computer software and will run their programs in the physical environment. When the microprocessor is attached to sensors and motors, new adaptive machines can be created to respond to the environment, all programmed from the architect’s laptop. Architects are combining the two realms, attaching microprocessors and sensors onto the ends of 6-axis robot arms, giving them new capabilities to sense their environments as they perform their construction processes. In both areas of invention, the open-source community is a thriving component of their success, with forums ( Grasshopper ), video tutorials ( Youtube ), and step-by-step instructions ( Instructables ). These forums help ease the traditionally steep learning curves for such software and hardware. The first project discussed is Fabric Forms, which takes the precision of robots and the freedom of fabric and creates a new casting technique for concrete. Rigid formwork is replaced by Lycra, which is stretched by 6-axis robots to precisely create unique shapes that can be bolted together. The second project is Minafold Pavilion by Perkins+Will. Aluminum is re-considered as both cladding and a self-supporting structural material. Curvature and folding are used to build this 100lb canopy for the 2016 Greenbuild Expo in Los Angeles. 192 laser cut, brake-formed aluminum pieces are riveted together to create a parametric minimal surface. 20 employees out of the Los Angeles office of Perkins+Will volunteered for the design and construction of the project.",

    "content": "I recently had the opportunity to test the new Fenestra PRO software (v3.0) for energy and sustainability analysis. According to them: “FenestraPro Premium for Revit is an intuitive and easy to use add-in that enables architects to design energy efficient building façades to comply with building regulations and required performance, without compromising the aesthetic of the façade.” Plus the fact that it is a ADD-IN for Revit and therefore discards the hassle of exporting and import, it sounded really promising. Could they have finally figured out a way of having a realtime energy analysis that could prove itself useful and help when designing? So I chose a project in the office for testing. The project is a residential tower, which is part of a masterplan in Sao Paulo, developed in a competition led by Jo Palma. This project was perfect as it had a really interesting curvy massing. The idea was to try to understand how the massing shape would influence self shading. On the meeting we had with Simon Whelan, from FenestraPRO, he had already showed some reserves to import a model with curves to be analysed. And he was right, the model didn’t work. His suggestion at the meeting was to breakdown the curve into a series of straight lines and then it would work. I found that Workarounds like those render softwares useless when it comes to competitions. That was disappointing as the information contained on the software is indeed very comprehensive and useful. Not only does it provide energy analysis on the massing but it compares it to different standards and advises if one is compliant or not with a particular rating system or requirement. I decided then to quickly change the massing and update the model to try the detailed model analysis. Yet another dispointment. Apparently FenestraPRO only analyses horizontal shading and not vertical. So no good. Maybe next time we develop a building with a horizontal shading system I might think of this software again. Another point that for me was not great was the information output. It does provide a lot of data, but in a spreadsheet format not as an appealing graphic. In a competition that would mean that someone from the team would have to run the analysis, digest it, and then produce the graphics to make competition-ready. That’s just time that we don’t have. All and all, the software does have some potential as it provides lots of data. However and sadly these things seem to continue to be designed with no real connection to how architects work and therefore they do not reach their full potential. I tried it later in a really basic model and it did work eventually however the graphic output was always never great. For the studio where I am working at the moment this does not seem to be a useful tool but perhaps it will help somebody at Perkins+Will who really wants to justify a design decision based on sustainability and energy performance. As long as they have the time to translate the information to make it presentation ready.",

    "content": "The following is intended for an internal Perkins+Will audience. During the second week of October, Yehia Madkour (Vancouver), and Jeremy Leubker (San Francisco), were working at the new Autodesk BUILD Space facility in South Boston, on this prototype (image below) – A 1 to 1 slice of the Great Northern Way (Vancouver Project) Pavilion, 2×8’s cut, nailed, assembled on the rig and ready for 5 axis CNC milling: For more photos taken during their time at BUILD Space, follow this link . WHAT IS AUTODESK BUILD SPACE? The facility is an innovation studio and industrial R&D workshop for digital fabrication in the building industry. Follow this link to see a video of the BUILD Space Opening Day. WHAT WAS BEING WORKED ON BY PERKINS+WILL? Yehia and Jeremy were building a complex-curvature nail laminated timber (NLT) panel as a proof of concept prototype for the Great Northern Way (GNW) Pavilion construction. This is a corporate research effort to explore various forms and assemblies achievable with wood construction and made possible through digital fabrication. They used standard 2×8 lumber, laminated them together with aluminum nails into a faceted shell. The shell was then milled by a 5-axis CNC router to achieve a smooth interior finished surface. WHAT IS THE GREAT NORTHERN WAY PAVILION PROJECT? This is a project of the Vancouver office of Perkins+Will: A single storey food and beverage retail pavilion situated within St. George Plaza, at the heart of the future Emily Carr University campus at Southeast False Creek in Vancouver, BC. It signifies an entrance and provides a landmark to the campus. The pavilion sits next to our recently-designed Great Northern Way office building, the Central Valley Greenway bike route and the planned future Millennium Line Skytrain station.

    "content": "Virtual Reality (VR) is transforming how we design and collaborate in Architecture. VR is no longer just a gimmicky toy used to impress the client, but rather a tool that designers and architects are using for themselves on projects to expedite design process, improve design communication, and enhance the design experience in order to produce a much better product. Inspired by how VR could be used for design, Senior Project Designer and Architect, Sarika Bajoria took on the challenge and embarked on a week-long integrated VR in design collaboration with CityScape Digital, a London based visualization firm specializing in Virtual Reality. The University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) Center for Healthcare Technology project was selected for this effort. Specifically, the lobby entrance area of the new building was chosen for the VR collaboration since it has a reasonably defined scope. The lobby was large enough to have an interesting VR experience, yet small enough to be completed within the timeframe of a week. Sarika and her team’s mission was to design the overall entry experience starting from the landscaped plaza, lobby, café, informal meeting space, reception area, all connected by a feature sculptural folded wall which transitions into a folded ceiling plane to integrate LED screens for “immersive” technology display. Using the VR system as an experiential design tool, Sarika hoped to experience the lobby as she and her team design every aspect of the building entrance. Joel from Cityscape joined Sarika for this VR collaboration and was seated next to her as they worked together for the week. An adjacent open area (about 120 square feet) was used to setup the room scaled VR system (HTC Vive) for the VR experience. The first task for the VR collaboration was to convert the project’s current 3D BIM model into the gaming software (Unreal Engine). The 3D model was gathered from various sources of different formats including Revit, Rhino and 3D Max. By the end of the first day, a VR version of the building and lobby was ready to be examined in VR on the HTC Vive system. Sarika and her team members were able to walk around the building lobby in its basic form, with default shading and lighting. The immediate reaction from our designers was one of a delightful surprise. Even though the designers were familiar with every inch of the lobby space, they were still surprised at their own feeling of how it felt to walk around the lobby space in virtual reality. The next step was to refine the lobby space by mapping the finished materials onto the various different surfaces, and adding in all the lighting conditions as designed. Once the material and lighting were added, the space started to look and feel almost photo realistic. Sarika then focused on redesigning the ceiling panels adjusting the panel tessellation angles based on what she had experienced in VR. The process was an iterative process of adjusting and reviewing in VR, then making the changes in the modeling software. Once the design was reasonably set, the design team members were invited to critique the design by experiencing the design themselves in VR. As the designers themselves had said “the VR gives you an immediate sense of scale and dimensionality that is better than any combination of plans, elevations, sections or 3D perspectives can give you.” Robert Goodwin, Design Director and Principal, even added that “in VR you instantly see and feel the space. You see all the good as well as the not so good things in your design from every angle in the Virtual Space”. Sarika noted that in addition to design iteration of the ceiling panels, in the VR environment the design team tested different material options, scales and patterns of floor and wall panels, adjusted the angles and scale of folded ceiling and wall, tested design options for the reception desk and articulated many design details. They also studied the relationship between the exterior and interior space of ground floor “urban room” and how it connects the pedestrian movement and activates the streetscape. Even though the original mission of the VR collaboration was for internal design purpose only, the Project team was so delighted with the VR experience that they decided to share the VR experience with the client as well. After a successful client VR showing in the New York office, the client requested to have the VR setup brought to the client site in Philadelphia to show the rest of the client team. The client was incredibly excited with the VR technology and is looking forward to see more VR used for future design review and collaboration. The VR in design experiment was a success, as Sarika puts it, “this was a true collaboration with Rob Goodwin, Christine Kim, Cityscape and myself which was the strength of this exercise”, being able to engage the clients and expedite design review process using VR was just an added bonus to the experiment.

    "content": "MINAFOLD PAVILION Too often in the design profession, sustainability is treated like a check-list one must to go through in order to satisfy a certain quota to ‘green-wash’ a project, resulting in dull sustainability ‘solutions’ and even duller buildings and forms. But what if we could re-evaluate the way we apply technology to traditional materials, discover ways to maximize performance to achieve minimal waste and design a new construction methodology along the way? For Greenbuild 2016, we decided to answer these questions with the Minafold Pavilion. PW Minafold Pavilion Video from PW Digital Practice The Minafold Pavilion is an exploration in material performance. This canopy poses the question, “Can the properties of a single material be maximized to achieve minimal waste and compose a visual performance?” The pavilion encompasses a 10x10x8’ volume, while only weighing 100 lbs. This structure removes traditional columns and beams and uses double curvature to create rigidity. The Minafold Pavilion uses 177 square feet of recycled sheet material (18 Gauge Aluminum) and turns it into a self-supporting structural element through bending (at the macro scale) and folding at the micro scale. The surface is then triangulated and perforated with a variable size aperture. The perforations transform from small holes at the base, where stiffness is required, into a lattice at the top where flexibility is needed. Each of the 192 unique panels is laser cut with holes and labels built into the algorithm. A brake form is used to fold the connection tabs where a rivet is driven through to join them. All aspects of the design were parametrically controlled from the location of rivet holes to the laser-etched connection labels. The construction process was streamlined by a “paint by number” catalogue system that made it easy for someone to build without prior experience, or even an understanding of the final design intent. A 3D file and 2D drawing of each component was provided on site to create a set of easily-understood instructions. To achieve the Minafold Pavilion, we employed a novel construction process that re-thinks traditional notions of lightness, sustainability, and structure. The Pavilion made its debut at the 2016 Greenbuild Expo in Los Angeles on October 6th, 2016 and was warmly received by attendees, gaining its own following with the hashtag #Minafold . ​ This project represents a critical point in time when architecture is emerging out of a drawing-based industry and utilizing design-to-fabrication workflows. Both the laser cutter and brake form were computer-controlled, removing much of the human interface, traditionally associated with a project of this size. Not only was the 3D model necessary in communicating the design, but it was essential for calculating structural behavior, simulating the effects of gravity, and studying the material characteristics of aluminum. A much more involved synergy between architect, engineer, and fabricator was essential to the success of the pavilion, and will pave the way for future collaborations. The strategy employed in this canopy can be easily translated into a building façade, interior partition, or stand-alone sculptural element. These interventions into the realm of architecture are challenging not only the forms we create, but are expanding our role as architects. As most contractors are not familiar with the methods employed, the architect is essential in alleviating doubt and streamlining the fabrication and mock-up phases. Architects should no longer be afraid to employ their own assemblies and systems as long as they are working closely the fabricator in alleviating the cost-overruns typical in custom work. Parametric design is known for its ability to create variation and experimental forms, but the often overlooked aspect of parametric design is the ability to rationalize sculptural work into easily fabricated elements, even making the fabricator’s job easier by adding details like rivet holes and laser etching numbers. This aspect of parametric design will advance the profession not just in what we build, but in how we build.

The keynote speaker, Chris Fussell was a former special forces leader in the middle east and now works for the McChrystal Group and helped write Team of Teams . Today’s Environment: Complex The Problem: Efficiency The Solution: Adaptability This talk was based on the Cynefin Model which is a framework that helps you sense what model you are functioning out of in order to make better decisions and avoid problems. So based on a simple system where best practice is the right way to execute you can see as things become more unordered because of the evolution of human behavior and technology there becomes a gap from the traditional top down org charts and processes in place that can’t account for the new framework in place. The fundamentals of an Elite Small Team are; Trust Common Purpose Shared Consciousness Empowered Execution So organization leaders need to lead like a gardner, you don’t make the plants grow but enable, tend, and protect them to give them the right environment to thrive in. Silos among departments and studios are typically tribal and not logistical.   So how do you break the silos; There are many deep cultural barriers you have to recognize and acknowledge one way to break them down is exchange key individuals to understand the other culture and bring back the connection to their own team create a structure and transparency for the autonomous team to make decisions & have high levels of accountability find ways so process and leadership behaviour come together We need to find the balance to gain the adaptability, agility and comradery of a small teams but the resources and vast knowledge of a large organization",

    "content": "A physical mock up for an interior project is often quite costly and requires dedicated space and a construction crew to be built, which cost our clients precious resources and time. As a proof of concept, our project team wanted to test the theory that a Virtual Reality mock up could eliminate the need for the construction of a physical mock up or at least speed up the process of creating one. Proposed. Although in the end our experiment did not completely eliminate the need for physical mock ups (just yet), it certainly demonstrated the tremendous benefit that VR brings to the project and more importantly the potential that VR has in transforming the design review process for future design projects. How it all started After experiencing a demonstration of augmented reality using the Hololens, Senior Project Architect, Diana Davis, wanted to bring her project into Virtual Reality. Diana proposed to use a small Patient Exam Room on her Mayo Clinic project to be used for a Virtual Mock Up. The idea was to test how a virtual mock up would fare in comparison to a physical mock up, and to explore how VR can be used to improve the interior design review process. A typical patient exam room was chosen for the VR experiment for various reasons. First, the patient exam room has a small footprint. The room fits within the 15’x15’ size of the VR operating space, which means the user can comfortably explore the space without the need to “teleport” in the virtual world. Second, the client was already familiar with other existing patient exam rooms of similar design, thus experiencing a familiar virtual space will make it less shocking to the client, and probably easier to relate to the virtual room. And finally, since the proposed design change to the room is minimal, the client should have an easier time to comprehend the design differences in the virtual environment. As the VR coordinator, I enlisted the help of our visualization expert, Dan Creekmore, from the P+W Viz Lab in Dallas to collaborate with the rest of the design team in Atlanta. Dan’s mission was to bring the Revit model into the VR HTC Vive system. The process involves exporting the 3D model from Revit into 3D Studio Max to polish it up by applying texture mapping and proper lighting, then render and “bake” the texture maps onto the 3D geometry. The design team provided finish material specifications for all the different surfaces in the model. The visualization team filled in the scene with additional equipment and accessories that were not in the Revit model and constructed them as 3D models by referencing the manufacturer’s specification provided. The final rendered model was then imported into Unity 3d, a gaming engine software, where VR rigs were setup and special effects (such as reflection probes, and laser pointers) were added into the model. Meanwhile, the HTC Vive system was shipped to Atlanta. Tyrone Marshall, Atlanta’s Design Application Manger, setup the Vive system for testing within the office. The system requires a dedicated computer, minimum of 225 square feet and two tripods to support the cameras which monitor the headset in space. After a quick calibration of the room boundary, the VR system was ready to be shared with the team. The team was excited to test the setup themselves and went through a few design iterations, refining finish materials and aditional details to the room. Everyone was surprised by the high fidelity of the virtual space, and how immersive the experience was. When all of the design changes were complete, the project team took the whole VR system with them and travelled to the Mayo Clinic in Florida. They setup the VR system in a small conference room at the Mayo Clinic and shared the Virtual Mock Up of the Patient Exam Room with the client’s design team, as well as many other curious doctors and nurses on site. After the VR experience, the clients were interviewed about their experience and offered invaluable feedback to our project team. Here is a sample of the questions: Have you ever used VR before? And in what capacity? What were your expectations around the design of the space prior to experiencing the virtual environment? In what ways were your perceptions altered by the space virtually? Does the experience impact your feeling of the space different from just looking at it on the paper? Did experiencing the space virtually at all change the feedback that you gave to us, vs. maybe having reviewed this in a different format? Would you consider the VR environment an improvement over the typical design review process? And in what ways did this differ from how this process normally proceeds? What would you suggest Perkins + Will incorporate into its virtual reality environment in order for you to get the most realistic experience possible? Overall, the experience was very positive. No one had any discomfort in using the VR headset, even though this was the first time any of them have ever used VR in any capacity. The clients found the color scheme of the space looked real, however the lighting looked very different – they commented that “it felt brighter than their current Exam Rooms”. They noticed even the smallest details ,pointing out things like “, such as the counter was being lit but there was no light fixture”. One thing they found quite surprising was how a design change felt completely different in VR than a change to a plan or elevation, and how they had imagined the space would have felt like. For example, the proposed design included eliminating a soffit and replacing it with a wall sconce. Previously, they were quite convinced that the change would have negatively impacted the feel of the room, and would have spent a lot of time discussing that change and required a much longer time to get final approval. As they said, “it would take a lot longer than 40 hours of render time, maybe two months from now, to give it to contractor, we would still not be sure if we want to remove the soffit”. However, after experiencing the room in VR without the soffit, they were perfectly convinced that the proposed change is a non-issue, and said “it’s good to see it, and feel it [in VR], [the change] made the room really look bigger”. Proving that using VR can expedite design decisions from our clients. What the clients found lacking in this virtual mockup was social interaction. In a physical mockup, it helps that multiple people can simultaneously explore the same space. Others can see what you are seeing, and even when low fidelity foam board were used, they were able to move things around and were able to write their comments on the wall. Whereas with the VR headset, it is one person at a time, not only does it take much longer to explore the. Even though they can see what you are seeing on the projected screen, the interaction is not the same. Additional feedback included to have the ability to interact with equipment in the room. The client had asked, “is it possible to move the exam table?”, which is possible , but the feature was not included in this experiment. Although, the clients were not quite convinced that the Virtual mockup could replace a Physical mock up, they all agreed that “it could get you pretty quickly to a point where you feel pretty comfortable with what you are building in a mock up before you started”. For small rooms, Virtual mock ups can be supplemental rather than a complete replacement of the physical mock up. However, there are many cases for replacement when it is physically impossible or financially unfeasible to construct a physical mockup. As the clients all agreed, they all “want[ed] to open the door and go down the hall“ to check out the rest of the building. Their suggestion was to do another VR experience of the double height lobby space that would most likely not be possible to have as a physical mock up.",

    "content": "As of February 2017 this recommendation still is 100% valid. Over the past several years Autodesk has released a portfolio of “Cloud” enabled applications which they refer to as BIM360. The Digital Practice team have reviewed and even piloted these new applications on projects across the firm.  None of these products are part of our firmwide subscription with Autodesk although we have access to all of them.  At this time we are not recommending their broad use. We have tools and workflows already in place to achieve similar results. The technology will improve [or be discontinued] and our team will continue to poke and prod these new applications and let everyone know if/when they are ready.  Below is a short list of products, their intended purpose and our recommended workflow, please share with anyone you feel this list can help. If you have any questions you can reach out to me or anyone else on the Digital Practice team. Collaboration for Revit –  Used to collaborate with associate designers who are not on our network – not recommended to use at this point, product needs more maturity.  Some current issues include; occasional (this has consistently happened over the last year almost every week) unexpected downtime during working hours with no warning, inability to link dwg or reference unique materials that will function at our associates site without workarounds.   There is also an added project cost. o    We have our internal cloud that can bring associate architects into our environment to work on models with us.   There is also an added project cost o   3 rd party cloud vendors can be investigated to host  models and Revit application just like our nodes.   This is an additional cost to the project. o    The recommended work flow is to properly divide the work either by building area or chronologically when possible so that a model split can occur between Perkins+Will and outside designers o    Some other technical considerations before about using this product.   The functionality of the software only allows for one model to be opened from C4R on a node, so only one user at a time could be working on a C4R model on any single node. (this has been resolved with Revit 2017) · BIM 360 Docs – Used to share documents across the entire team as the single source of truth – not recommended to use at this point, product needs more maturity.   There is also added project cost. o    The recommended work flow when the contractor does not have a platform is to suggest utilizing Newforma and their mobile apps o    Most construction field applications or document management solutions can provide this and should be part of an initial conversation with the contract manager. · BIM 360 Glue – Used to collaborate with the entire team on clash resolution – this works well as a product and can be used but does not typically fit into a Perkins+Will needed workflow.  There is also added project cost. o    Recommended workflow is to use Navisworks and Skype meetings screen share when team members can’t be physically present. o    If this is the preferred tool after construction documents are issued then it should be led by the construction manager. · BIM 360 Field – Used to enable construction contract administration workflows like RFIs, Submittals, Punchlists, etc. – can be used but is a project cost and should be decided in conjunction with a Construction Manager.   This cost could be taken on by the CM or possibly be shared among the parties depending on the project and requirements. o    This is typically a shared decision between all parties, unless we specify something in the general conditions of the specifications o    Many platforms accomplish these types of tasks, like PlanGrid, Aconex, E-builder, Prolog, Procore, and others.   All work in similar ways but Perkins+Will main concern with choosing any of these is to get an output of ALL activities at the completion of construction. o    The recommended work flow when the contractor does not have a platform is to suggest utilizing Newforma and their mobile apps · A360 Drive – used as a file share and file viewing platform – this is free as part of our subscription but we have other products that achieve similar outcomes and create an audit trail.   Also serves as their online file viewer which works with mobile apps.   Good for sharing and viewing CAD, DWF, Navisworks and Revit models online.",

    "content": "Overview Enscape is a live rendering plugin that works within Revit.  Creating a live walk through (navigating in real time with a controller) is as simple as creating a camera view (using its visibility settings to hide objects that are not need to be rendered), and pressing run.  A new window will pop up during loading, and, depending on the complexity of the geometry and the power of the computer, the live rendered scene will be done in several minutes.  The navigations are simple – either keyboard (WASD) + mouse, or the use of a game controller (XBox) – allowing a simulating walk or fly through.  With this scene window open, changes made in the project view will update in the view, allowing for (almost) instant feedback on design changes.  Oculus Rift VR is supported. Dionysus Cho and I have been testing Enscape 3D on a number of our projects using different hardware configurations (more details below). We would like to share this insight for the things we learned so far: What works Enscape is quick and easy.  With the Coalition office, the project has some complex Rhino/Grasshopper geometries that are imported in Revit.  Loading an Enscape scene took about 2 minutes, and we instantly had a fully walkable and textured space.  We could work through the design live, panning and orbiting around the space to get a sense of the installation, facilitating quick edits.  Work done back in the project view (or syncing) will update the scene automatically.  After changes were made, the team needed some quick renders that show the space rather than being photo-realistic.  Instead of setting up cameras and  rendering them out on the A360 cloud (our typical workflow), within minutes, we were able to run through various angles, producing captures and a dozen views in 10 minutes rather than hours.  These views can then be post-processed, supplementing the live scene. What doesn’t work In testing with the SFU SUB building, a Higher Ed project which is fairly large and complex, Enscape ran into problems that are typical with normal renderers – multiple overlapped geometries causes constant flickering (eg. Multiple instances of floors, columns in walls), lighting was strange in areas, and materials worked in some areas, but were off in others.  I believe that these issues were not entirely the fault of Enscape, but a model that was not tuned for rendering.  With a better understanding of the requirements of Enscape, and with access to the plugins so we would be able to model and view throughout the process, these issues should be smoothed over.  The limitations of the rendering engine, however, were noticeable in comparison with other live-rendering engines (eg. Unreal Engine), though the timeframe of the process makes it a different tool.  The loading time was significantly longer (several minutes) than the previous project, but the ability to export a standalone scene would negate this issue.  I plan to evaluate this with our nodes / laptops to see how well they run these scenes in testing.  I also tested the Oculus Rift VR setup with a previous version of the software (they have been pushing out updates to add features and stability) and there were some bugs that made it hard to use (eye level was off, and quality was rather low). Use in design Enscape has an incredible potential in the design process.  Not only was I able to quickly visualize spaces and changes, I was able to review these with others live – we could look at any angle and range, allowing for us to scrutinize design choices that we might otherwise have had to rely on a still render (or guess).  Moreover, the ability to produce very quick screen captures at will dramatically cut down the tedious workflow of setting up cameras and pushing renders to the cloud.  Using Enscape in the workflow (Coalition interior) rather than testing it after completion (SFU SUB), showed a dramatic difference.  Enscape is quite promising, and with their push for updates, it will be both a great design tool and a replacement for still renders. Next step is to test differnet hardware setups with Enscape and report back. We will be updating this page soon. Stay tuned. 1.       Lenovo 450s (Enscape not reliable, slow panning, crashes often) 2.       Lenovo X1 Yoga (not yet tested) 3.       Alienware 15R2 (works very well) 4.       Alienware with Oculus Rift (buggy, needs further testing) 5.       Node with remote desktop connection (not yet tested)",

    "content": "With all the different Virtual Reality(VR) gadgets that are available today, it is really difficult to differenciate between these VR gadgets and decide which one you should be using or buying for your next project. Basically, most of these gadgets are just VR goggles, with the exception of the Hololens which is considered an Augmented Reality(AR) or Mixed Reality(MR) goggle. Let’s take a closer look at what the VR and AR goggles do and why you should use one over the other. Virtual Reality As soon as you put on a VR goggle, you are completely blocked off from the real world and transported into a virtual world. With a VR goggle on, you cannot see the real objects around you, but you can see all the virtual object displayed within the goggle. VR Goggle is an ideal tool to use to bring your audience into an imaginary world, where they can experience what a newly designed space could look like and feel like as they move around in that space. VR experiences can be presented in any place, it can be a mobile VR or a tethered VR system, all depending on the quality of the experience, and the portability of the system you need. Augmented Reality On the other hand, Augmented Reality first appeared as an iPad and iPhone apps a few years ago, later gained popularity with the infamous Goggle Glass. But the latest buzz is all about the Microsoft Hololens, the newest AR/MR goggle. Putting on a pair of Hololens will feel more like wearing a helmet with a glass mask over your face. You can still see through the glass and look at the real objects surrounding you, except now there are virtual objects appearing on top of  the real objects and thus augmenting your experience of this mixed reality. In this mixed reality world, you can simulate how a virtual object would interact with the physical objects in the real world. Place a full size virtual sofa in the corner of a room and see if it will fit in that space or not. Bounce a virtual ball off the real wall and watch it bounce back. Punch a virtual hole in the wall and take a peek at the MEP and Structural data that goes behind that gyp board in the wall. With the Hololen’s front depth sensing cameras, you can also share what you see with others who are far away through the built-in camera. You can collaborate remotely with your design team and redesign the building as if they are right there. You can be watcing a live football game in front of you, and have instant analysis of the play appear over the real players and the field just as they would appear on a TV or in a video game. The possibilities of using the Hololens in this mixed reality world are endless, but we are still actively exploring and developing tools and apps that could eventually change the way AR is used for the AEC industry. Mobile VR If mobility is high on your priority list, then you should choose one of these mobile VR options. Mobile VR solution typically involves a goggle running on a mobile phones. Mobile VR offers great convenience for the traveling teams that need to present to clients at different sites. They are easy to transport, fits right in your bag, and easy to setup. But it does not have the highest image quality nor the smoothest experience as it is limited by the processing power of the mobile phone. Mobile VR is great for panorama and simple 3D models. Samsung’s GearVR and Google Cardboards are two options presented here. GearVR ($99 plus Samsung Galaxy phone $500-$680) The Samsung GearVR is still the most convenient VR option for decent quality VR experience (60 frames per second). GearVR offers both 360 panorama and 3D model viewing options. Most P+W offices already have a pair of the GearVR, and we have firmwide cloud services setup with InsiteVR to help design team with the Revit to GearVR transfer process. Contact your local DA for details. Google Cardboard ($10 plus user provides the phone) Google Cardboard is a good affordable option for mobile VR. We now have P+W branded cardboard boxes that project teams can give out to clients as a leave behind. Typically, Google Cardboard is best used for viewing 360 panoramas. Using tools such as RouneMe will give you the option to showcase your design work on the web. Contact the Digital Practice Group for P+W branded cardboards. Tethered VR: For a higher quality VR experience than what the mobile VR can provide, you can try one of the tethered VR system listed below, HTC Vive or Oculus Rift.  A tethered VR system uses a goggle that is powered by a strong graphic PC or laptop, typically the machine needs to be VR certified in order for the system to run smoothly. With a tethered VR system, users can experience a refresh rate of 90+ frames per second and you can load up a much larger files than a mobile system can handle. The smoothness of the VR experience is directly tied to the Graphics processing power (GPU) of the PC. Typically you will need a VR certified PC system with a multi core CPU, 32 GB RAM, and a single or double GTX980 or higher graphics card. Depending on which system you choose, you will need to visit their website to find the list of certified VR PC that will work with that specific system. HTC Vive ($799 plus a VR ready machine $1800 – $2800) The HTC Vive is the only room scale VR system on the market (for now). The room scale VR tracks the user’s position within the room and provides the user a fully immersive experience. The user can simply walk around the space (max of 15’x15’) to explore the virtual environment. With two hand held remotes, the HTC Vive also offer hand tracking, which enables the user to see their virtual hands as remote controllers inside the virtual world which further enhances their presence in that Virtual world. Compared to all the other VR systems, users on HTC Vive have the best VR experienced and almost never complains about any motion sickness. For a list of HTC Vive ready PC, visit https://www.htcvive.com/eu/ready/ . Also, for portability, order a pair of tall tripods with swivel heads when you don’t want to attach the lighthouse boxes onto the walls. Oculus Rift ($599 plus a VR ready machine $1800 – $2800) The Oculus Rift is similar to the Vive, but it offers more of a seated experience or a standing experience within a much smaller area than the Vive’s. Oculus is on-par in terms of resolution and refresh rate as the HTC Vive system, it also needs a VR ready PC to power the VR experience. Currently its tracked remote controllers(Oculus touch) are not yet released. Instead, users are using an xbox controller to navigate within the space. For a list of Oculus ready PC, visit https://www3.oculus.com/en-us/oculus-ready-pcs/. ; Augmented Reality (AR): Hololens ($3000) The Hololens is truly one of a kind Augmented Reality goggle. As a fully standalone unit, the Hololens does not need any external PC to power it. With a pair of Hololens, one can see virtual objects appear as holograms on top of real world objects and one can interact with these holographic objects directly using voice and gesture control. It also has an amazing spatial mapping capability which starts by scanning your surrounding area, storing it as a map and reconstruct it as a virtual model which can interact with any virtual objects that bring into this mixed reality world. For example, you can throw a virtual ball onto a real wall and see it bounce off the wall inside the Hololens. Because of its transparent visor, the Hololens works best in a dimly lit area with darker walls. For viewing large scale building, it is recommended to view the model in a large open space with no furniture in it. This will allow you to move around freely without running into obstacles. A few caveats of the Hololens are its limited Field of View(FOV), heaviness of the device and the lack of fully developed apps in the Window’s app store. The small FOV of the Hololens makes it feel like you are looking through a window frame, you will need to turn your head around a lot more than you would normally do just to be able to see objects that are in your peripheral vision. As a self contained unit, the Hololens basically has a mini PC inside the visor. It is noticeably heavier than the other VR goggles listed above. One can only wear the goggles for a short period of time before it becomes uncomfortable. If you have any good ideas on a project that would work well in a mixed reality environment using the Hololens, please contact the Digital Practice group.",

Worry no more! This app dramatically simplifies the process. After searching for a location, you can tweak what gets sent by moving or resizing the selected area on the map. Then just send to Flux, and you will get the following sweet geometry, all neatly divided up into separate Flux data keys: Mesh representations of surrounding buildings, using height data from Open Street Map . Additional building meshes using a pre-defined height range for when data is not available (the default randomly extrudes profiles to between 10m and 20m). Building profiles as polylines. A super sweet topographic mesh, at a resolution of ⅓ arc second (10 m) from the US Geological Survey , which sources its data from NASA’s Shuttle Radar Topography Mission . Topographic contour lines, based on user defined elevation intervals (default is 1m). Roads as polylines Parks as polylines Water features as polylines Once you have the data in Flux, you can move it into SketchUp, Rhino or even Revit with the click of a button. The latest update to the Site Extractor adds a whole lot more awesome to your workflow. With a single click you can generate a 4 square kilometer model of detailed topography, surrounding buildings, roads, parks and waterways. Go to Flux Site Extractor",

The goal is to streamline our design approval process and save the client precious time and money. The team is currently developing a Virtual Exam Room that can supplement if not all together replace the expensive and time consuming process of constructing a physical Mock Up, which the client intends to build. The idea is to develop a virtual space that our client can “walk-around” and experience design options while providing real-time feedback. The Perkins+Will team is developing the virtual space using a combination of new applications and hardware, Unity and the HTC Vive. The Vive is a room scale VR system and the best solution currently on the market for this Virtual Mock Up project. The Atlanta design team has already created the 3D spaces in Revit with basic furniture and equipment. The Viz team will model any remaining specialty equipment and furniture, assign materials and finally, simulate the natural and artificial lighting conditions. When the scene is completed, the model will be “ bake d” and exported for Unity3D, a Gaming Engine. The final step is adding the proper Camera and Controller objects in the Virtual environment. Additional interactivities can also be added, such as moveable objects and design options. The hardware and model will be shipped to the Atlanta office for in-house testing, before taking it to our client’s site for evaluation. Stay tuned to the Digital Practice News Page for the progress posting of this VR mockup project!",

    "content": "The Revit Technology Conference (RTC) is an annual event designed to cater to the needs of the BIM community. The conference was held earlier this month in the breezy desert outside Phoenix. This year the firm had three attendees, Helen Gornia, Adam Hamilton and Chris Coscia. The conference has expanded and now includes several “Summits” which are additional days focused on specific topics, including Data and Content. The main Conference RTC is a unique, independent conference covering all things BIM and the whole ecosystem that supports it. The Building Content Summit is an event dedicated toimproving BIM content. The summit brings together individuals representing three groups: Designers, Manufacturers and Service Providers. The Data Day event was specifically focused on both the current and potential use of data within the AECO/FM industry. Below is a take away from each of the events. RTC Perkins+Will leadership and collaboration with Autodesk on project Fractal was presented as part of Autodesk look into the future keynote. Along with Autodesk, HP introduced amazing new 3D printing technology and also taught us what a voxel was. During keynote speaker Ashraf Habibullah’s address we learned “Every time the wind blows a structural engineer saves a life”. What followed was three days of intense Revit – centric training classes enthusiastically presented by industry experts. This year a lot of classes focused on computational design – Dynamo workflows, Macros as well as new features in 2017. Dynamo classes tended to deal less with the abstract, using Dynamo for Dynamo’s sake, but focus more on specific real-world solutions to common workflow hang-ups. One of the highlights of new features was the demonstration of various uses of Global-Parameters and how they have been expanded to multiple categories. And, of course there were classes on new and exciting features coming with Revit 2017. Classes handouts and datasets will be available to download soon, and will be posted on Pulse for Perkins+Will staff to peruse. Building Content Summit The Building Content Summit is an event dedicated to improving BIM content by bringing together thought leaders from around the worlds of Design, Manufacturing and Software/Services. In its second year we have seen measurable progress in developing content management platforms, some free architectural details, and applications for building content. There are still heated discussions about content standards, their scope and expectations, however Industry is developing tools for content “language” development and translation tools, and most importantly, collaboration and understanding between stakeholders. Perkins+Will participation and development efforts put us in a leadership position when it comes to managing BIM content.Also noteworthy is participation of owners  and a first attempt of creating a National BIM Guideline for Owners Data Day A  whole day  workshop focused on data use in the AECO/FM industry. There were presentations and discussions about role of data in BIM, which data gets into our models, which is stored and connected externally, as well as usability of the data delivered to the owner/FM.BIM world use multiple tools for design and documentation, we talked about strategies and practicalities of data-driven interoperability for synchronous design and workflows between various modeling software. I also want to mention a data resource I see as a potential game changer in design data availability for healthcare https://www.sepstobim.org/ We discussed practical methods and approaches to collecting, sorting, visualizing and analyzing our business related data – from the model and network performance to capturing and analysing business and financial metrics during project lifecycle. Many discussions revolved around  technology demands nessecitating changes in architectural practice, venturing into software development, data science and other domains of knowledge.",

    "content": "The Digital Practice team would like to share our current plan on rolling out Revit 2017 to the firm. Autodesk typically release new software versions in April, in recent years this has been coupled with a “mid year” update. It has become the norm that the “mid year” release include new and required features, but perhaps more importantly it has fewer bugs. We expect the Revit 2017 mid-year release to become available this fall, at which time we will begin finalizing the process of making Revit 2017 the standard Perkins+Will platform. Currently the plan is to make Revit 2017 available to all teams by the end of the 2016. Besides enhancements, the Revit 2017 release will also include changes which may pose challenges to our teams upgrading models and tools. Autodesk has updated the scripting language used to create add-ins, this will impact the time our team as well as 3rd party developers need to make past add-ins compatible with Revit 2017, if at all. Another change that potentially has a large impact is how Revit 2017 will now format Text. Autodesk has stated that there are no guarantees that text will not be affected by the upgrade process, ie Revit 2016 to 2017. The Digital Practice team will monitor the text effect and propose solutions for teams as we learn more, this will not be a problem for projects beginning models in Revit 2017, it will actually be a welcome improvement. We will have additional information and informational sessions of all the new features that Revit 2017 has to offer as we get closer to rolling out the new version.",

    "content": "Below are Doug Green’s notes from the BIM Forum conference which\ntook place April 20-21st 2016 in Minneapolis. The BIM Forum’s\nmission is to facilitate and accelerate the adoption of modeling in\nthe AEC industry. If you have any additional questions or comments\nplease leave them below and we can get the answer. James Vandezande from HOK was the conference co-chair. Theme throughout – do what adds value to the project and process – “Is the juice worth the squeeze?” University of Ohio has a “Buckeye BIM Initiative” that might be interesting to look at. The Elliott Bay Seawall project in Seattle was presented by Josh Rogers from Mortenson.  They applied VDC from vertical to horizontal, 4D to show sequencing on a very restricted job site.  Made the decision of what BIM tools to use after analyzing the project and project risks. There is no such thing as an LOD (whether level of development or level of detail – see later notes) for an entire model.  The model is always a mixture of various LODs. “Perfection is not attainable . . . but if we chase perfection we can attain excellence.”  Vince Lombardi. The LOD Specification will be published for comment on June 20, 2016. Comment period will run into August 2016.  It will be a downloadable document and intended as suitable for all project delivery types.  The LOD Specification is a “dictionary” and the project and delivery method is the “story”. HITT Construction did a presentation on the use of drones.  Safety and planning are huge issues.  One of their drones had a battery that went out and the drone crashed.  To avoid injury, the fly zone needs to anticipate where the drone would fall if something happens to avoid injury.  A pilot license is no longer needed, but one does need the FAA exemption which takes time (seems to be several months).  Insurance runs about $1500. Holder Construction and others during the course of the conference discussed laser scanning.  The most significant issue is the internal issue: who on the staff actually does the scanning?  Do you train and have on staff scan specialists, or do you have the field teams do the scanning?  Significant issue to set up on a coordinate system, and file size is an issue.  Accuracy was discussed by several, not as accurate as one would think.  And buildings move so even if accurate at one point in time, may no longer be accurate later. Scans should be interpreted, but never imported into a model. There is often a disconnect between the model and the construction. It is much better to go from 3D to 2D for drawings. There was a very interesting “BIMForum Lego Experience” which recreated the challenges of a team constructing a building. You have to “cheat” software to achieve field reality. Buildings are “living breathing” and move and change, software does not.  A building is a “body in motion”. Design modeling and construction modeling are very different things. There is no such thing as a zero-clash model. Version 2 of the ConsensusDocs BIM Addendum was discussed.  For several reasons I do not recommend its use. The document now adds a “Level of Granularity” description which deals with dimensional accuracy, in addition to “Level of Detail” (the richness of the detail) and “Level of Development” (the completeness of the detail). A more detailed review by both legal and digital practice is probably a good idea to understand this document in more detail.  But of concern, it replaces the definition of “Contract Document” in the underlying agreement, has “check the box” provisions to over-ride the 2D documents, automatically adopts the LOD Specification, and in my view generally has too many “traps for the unwary” for less sophisticated adopters, who I fear could find themselves in pretty deep water without knowing what they are getting into. I believe it is a document developed by sincere and passionate advocates for pushing the industry to what they consider a better place, but it may not be connected with current industry reality. The document was called a “construction contract” and the “first in the U.S.” It requires “tech protect” insurance policies (we are exploring but do not have and many firms do not – no uniformity of coverage and questionable cost/benefit), contemplates the model actually running the building, operates from the standpoint of cutting edge things that are being done, but not commonly. RFI’s processed in the model. O & M manuals are embedded in the model. A new section on commissioning and turnover, BIM used for training the operations and maintenance staff, and on and on. Expands the design phase considerably, including constructability, life cycle analysis, VE, shop and fabrication modeling, tolerance requirements for digital fabrication, sustainability analysis, record model, conformed design model. It is unclear who tracks changes, or how changes are tracked. Retooled the insurance and BIM IP rights. There was a presentation regarding the use of the National BIM Standard put out by the BuildingSMART Alliance.  The National BIM Standard apparently tracks the various BIM Guidelines that different organizations are using. A lack of consistency was noted in that regard. All of them describe BIM deliverables. The United Kingdom mandates that public projects over £85 million must have BIM. The National BIM Standard is at version 3, there is a relatively small group of people involved and has reference standards. Version 3 includes new content:  “Practical BIM Contract Requirements”, a BIM Planning Guide for Owners, a Project Execution Planning Guide, etc.  Probably worth getting a copy. Who in the firm is tracking this? Pat O’Connor and another presented on the AIA Digital Practice Documents. Making the point that the normal disclaimer inhibits the use of a BIM and the expressed desire to get around that. The AIA documents set out a regime within which to share models. The E203 is the contractual framework, the G201 is the digital data protocol form, and the G201 is the BIM protocol for sharing models. The E203 has a “check the box” which allows either a selection of the standard type of disclaimer, or that the parties want to share models and will agree on the protocols and rules of engagement in the G202. The G202 is the broad stroke contractual standard and framework on how to share and use BIM. Models carry a lot of information that we do not even know is in the BIM.  For example we can use a placeholder to indicate a sliding door but not the exact kind of door.  So that is the general reason for a disclaimer approach, but a disclaimer essentially throws out the baby with the bathwater. The G202 says parties can only rely on what one says parties can rely on the BIM for.  That’s where the LOD scheme comes in.  That is, even if what is in the model appears to be a Level 400 if you say others can only rely on it for LOD 200 that’s all the parties can depend on.  Any other reliance is at a party’s own risk. The document sets out four steps that are fairly common in BIM development: Conceptual, Generic Placeholders, Specific Assemblies and then Details (note: the G202 does not use those terms, rather uses “Conceptual Design, Criteria Development, Detailed Design, Implementation Drawings”).  This does not correspond to the design phases. The G202 includes definitions of the various LODs (100, 200 etc.). LOD 500 is field verification. Of interest, there is a distinction between a “Level of Detail” and a “Level of Development”.  A Level of Detail is what it looks like.  A Level of Development is how much it has been thought through.  So even if it is a Level of Detail 400, if you say you can only rely on it for a Level of Development 200, that’s all. Especially note that deliverable models will have various levels of detail and development. During the Q & A sessions for the ConsensusDocs, National BIM Standard and the AIA Digital Practice documents, some interesting questions and points were made.  One person asked whether setting standards was just setting a level of mediocrity?  It was quickly pointed out that the industry has worked with standard for decades with no ill effect.  It was noted that the implementation of BIM in the U.S. has not really been very good, and that the rest of the world outside the U.S. is ramping up much more quickly. A representative from Gilbane discussed scanning, and said they use the RFI to simply document the discussion and decision that has already been completed, to memorialize it rather than using the RFI as the mechanism for asking the question, which I thought was an interesting approach. The Fall BIM Forum conference will be October 17 – 19, 2016, in Atlanta.  The theme is “What is the new standard for professional coordination?  Examining the changing standard of care for designers, contractors and owners.”",

    "content": "Scroll to next section Scroll to next section We are excited to announce that our financial and project accounting system is transitioning from Deltek Vision to Deltek Vantagepoint. This upgrade brings a modern browser-based interface, new features, and enhanced functionality. Additionally, Deltek has improved the mobile app, making it easier than ever to submit timesheets and expense reports on the go. This page provides detailed instructions on how to use Deltek Vantagepoint and the upgraded mobile app. For downloadable resource guides and reference sheets, please click the Training Materials button below. Timesheets Expense Reports Approvals Troubleshooting Training Materials Timesheets While the functionality of timesheets and expense reports in Deltek Vantagepoint is similar to Deltek Vision, the most challenging aspect will be navigating the new interface. Both timesheets and expense reports retain much of the same functionality, ensuring a smooth transition. Create New Timesheet Copy from Prior Filling Out the Timesheet Saving & Submitting Previous Previous Previous Next Next Next Creating a New Timesheet Select Timesheet from your left-side navigation bar In the top right corner of the Timesheets page select the white “+ New Timesheet” button Select your Timesheet period from the dropdown pop-up window If you have already started a timesheet, or would like to search for any timesheet, click on ‘My Timesheets’ in the top center of the screen Weeks will be categorized into the following: Missing – Timesheet has not been started.  Select the missing week from ‘+ New Timesheet’ In Progress – The timesheet was started but not sumitted.

Saving and Submitting Timesheets To Save your Timesheet press the blue “Save” button in the top right corner Wait for the blue banner to appear at the top to know your data is saved before closing the tab To submit your Timesheet, press the “Submit” button in the top right corner Agree that you are going to submit your timesheet Expense Reports Expense reports in Deltek Vantagepoint are similar to Deltek Vision and retain much of the same functionality. The mobile expense app allows you to snap a picture of receipts, then employs Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) technology, which automatically fills in certain fields such as amount, date, and category. Create A Expense Report Change Report Name Adding Expense Info Adding Receipts Copying Rows Submitting Expense Reports Previous Previous Previous Next Next Next Create New Expense Report From the Expense Report Tab, select the “+ New Expense Report” button in the top right corner Fill in the Report Name and Report Date To save, click the “Save” button in the top right Change the Report Name and Report Date Select the name of your report at the top of the Expense Report Fill in the updated Report Name and Report Date To save, click the “Save” button in the top right Adding Expense Information From left to right fill in your expense item details, including Business Reason in the Details button Add the price of the item to the Amount field Search for the Project Name and Phase by typing into the appropriate fields Note: To navigate faster and see more fields at once, you can click the expand icon (four diagonal arrows) in the top right To change the view to match Timesheets with Project information on the left, and expense info on the right: Select the “View: Default” button in the top right corner of the expense report From the drop down, select “Expense Firmwide” To change back to default, select “Restore Defaults” from the same dropdown Adding Receipts / Attachments To add receipts navigate to the far right side of your line item and click the paperclip symbol Add receipts either by selecting “+ Select files for upload” or by dragging your files into the bottom half of the pop up Select which attachments relate to your current line item Duplicating and Deleting Rows You can create new rows by pressing the “+ Add Line” button in the top left of your expense report Alternatively, you can copy a previously filled out line by clicking the “…” on the far right side of the line item and selecting “Copy”.  This will copy in all the project and expense information except for the Amount value To delete a line click on the “…” on the far right side of the line item and select “Delete “ Submitting (and Unsubmitting) Your Expense Report When you are ready to submit your report click the “Submit” button in the top right.  Select “yes” on the pop-up dialogue To digital “sign” your expense report you will be prompted to Sign-Out of Microsoft. Once signed out, enter your email and password and procede through the Windows Authentication Steps. If submitted correctly a blue banner will appear at the top. To unsubmit an expense report hit the Unsubmit button in the top right corner. Approvals This section contains instructions on how to approve timesheets and expense reports. Brand new in Vantagepoint is functionality for Project Managers to approve their client invoices in a “one-stop” location. This section includes instructions for reviewing, marking up, and approve client invoices within Vantagepoint. Monitor Monitor Web View Previous Previous Previous Next Next Next Timesheet Approvals An overview of how to approve Timesheets in Deltek Vantagepoint. If you have any questions, please contact your local Finance manager. Expense Report Approvals An overview of how to approve Expense Reports in Deltek Vantagepoint. If you have any questions, please contact your local Finance manager. Client Invoice An overview of how to approve Client Invoices in Deltek Vantagepoint. If you have any questions, please contact your local Finance manager. Troubleshooting Is there a mobile app? Yes!  The mobile app for Apple and Android is called Deltek T&E for Vantagepoint. Once installed, you can follow the below steps: 1.Agree to the Terms. 2.Sign in with the below Server URL, copied exactly: https://deltekvp.perkinswill.com/vantagepoint/touch/time 3.Click ‘Connect’ in the top right corner. 4.Ignore User ID and Password and check the slider for ‘Windows Authentication’ 5.Select ‘Log In’ 6.Authenticate with your company email and password. 7. Optionally, enable Face ID or a PIN. Where can I find overtime? Overtime for each timesheet cell is accessed by clicking the arrow on the time slot to expand the comment field, and then selecting the blue text for Add Overtime. Can I use the Copy from Plan option on my Timesheet? No, ‘Copy from Plan’ is not enabled at this time because it is tied to Deltek’s planning module, which we no longer use.  We use PMTK for our project planning and staffing needs. Why does it ask me to sign out when I submit an expense report? Unfortunately, we cannot control the wording of this page.  To submit an expense report you need to authenticate that you are you!  To do so, your SSO needs to be re-logged in, and signing out is the first step of this.  Don’t worry – you are doing everything correctly. The dates on my timesheet only show the month, how can i fix this? Go to the settings cog in the top right corner and select ‘My Preferences’ Under ‘General’ select the ‘Date Format’ drop down Select your preferred date format, such as M/D/YYYY Click ‘Save’ Training Materials PWU Training Videos Live trainings of Vantagepoint will be held in the Perkins&Will University Team Channel during the weeks of 5/19 and 5/27.

    "content": "BIM 360 QuickStart Guide Work Anywhere With Anyone BIM360 is a collaboration tool that enables more effective and efficient design and documentation workflows for the overall project team. The project files are on the cloud. The experience in working in Revit is the same.

A dedicated section of microKnowledge cards has already been created for BIM360, here are a handful of the most commonly used cards: Getting Started How Do I Log Into My Autodesk Account In Revit for BIM360 Access? How Do I Make my Revit File a Cloud Model in BIM360? How Do I Access BIM360 Docs (like an FTP site)? How Do I Open A Revit File On BIM360? How Do I link or reload a CAD file from BIM360 in Revit? How do I Upload A New CAD or Other Files To BIM360 Before Linking It Into Revit? How Do I Find a Local File For BIM360? How Do I Publish a Revit Cloud Model to a BIM360 Project? External Collaboration Uh-oh? How do I Coordinate Revit Models with consultants who are not using BIM360? How Do I Add Consultants To My BIM360 Project? How Do I Establish Permissions on a Folder on BIM360? How Do I Retrieve Backups in BIM360 How do I manually download an archive model from BIM360 How Do I Relinquish All Borrowed Elements on a Revit Cloud Model? Scroll to next section Scroll to next section Who purchases BIM360 Access for Consultants Others working collaboratively in Revit We can invite any of our consultants and external team members to BIM360 Docs at no charge to them.   This will give them access to upload and download files through the web interface .   If they would like to work off the cloud to avoid the administration overhead of needing to do those tasks on a regular basis they will need to purchase as many seats as necessary of BIM360 Design for as many people that work in Revit.   This would allow them to have the models hosted in the Autodesk cloud on the project we invited them to and save their work directly there.   If they don’t already have a reseller that they work with for their Autodesk purchasing then they can go directly to the website and purchase seats in whatever quantity and duration they see fit for their company. https://www.autodesk.com/products/bim-360-design/subscribe?plc=COLLRP&term=1-MONTH&support=ADVANCED&quantity=1 We will not be paying for our external team members to use our bim360 licensing to save to the cloud.   This is an extra value for them and not us and if that is how they want to conduct business they will need to budget accordingly.   If they currently not on BIM360 this should not matter to them or impact them. Adding them to the team in BIM360 Docs = Web browser access = Free Purchasing BIM360 Design with Revit Cloud Collaboration = Work in Revit on cloud hosted model = Paid for by their company Scroll to next section Scroll to next section Getting Your Project Setup Contact your local Digital Practice team member with the following info: Project name and number List of names who need immediate access to the project Designate a project BIM360 administator / model manager Update your Digital Execution Plan BIM360 optimizes the way you work, so it’s important the changes are reflected in your Digital Execution Plan (DxP). You won’t be exchanging models anymore, so you want to make sure consultants are publishing on a frequent basis or having Clarity publish their models for them. If you are using Issue Tracking, Markups, or Model Coordination, you will want to include that in your DxP as well. Best Practices Apply all Revit updates to your MSI from software center ASAP as they are published to stay consistent with the rest of your team Reboot your laptop regularly (daily, if possible) Log into Desktop Connector before you start Revit (or verify) When Revit opens, verify you are logged in Sync every 30 minutes to an hour max Open each model with audit and sync once a day DO NOT edit files in Desktop Connector Clear up cache weekly or bi-weekly Do not keep cloud Revit files open when switching networks (from docked to WiFi, from office to home) If using Design Collaboration, do not copy files manually into Shared and Consumed folders. They are automated Make sure you have decent internet speeds from where you are working. Autodesk recommends 5Mbps minimum-10Mbps value-25 Mbps performance Scroll to next section Scroll to next section Getting Help/Resources If you have trouble accessing BIM360, this will guide you through the proper steps to effectively troubleshoot the problem. If you are still experiencing issues, reach out to your local Design Applications Manager, the larger Digital Practice group using Teams, or send an email to help@perkinswill.com. Scroll to next section Scroll to next section The Web Side of BIM360 One of the new features of BIM360 is the web access to files for viewing and collaboration workflows from any device anywhere. What is a Publish? When you publish your Revit file, you are making your current save of the file available on the web side of BIM360. This publish contains the revit file along with its linked files, as well as any sheets or views. Let Clarity Publish Your Models In order to take advantage of the tools in BIM360 on the web, it is necessary to publish the models frequently. Clarity can save you lots of time by automating this task and publish all models every night, so you’ll be looking at the latest drawing set in the file viewer. Syncing vs. Publishing Document Management Interface The Document Management Module is the web-based file manager and viewer that acts as the backbone of the cloud sharing of files on BIM360. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 1 Company Hub 2 Current Project 3 Module Grid 4 Current Module 5 Module Tabs 6 Plans Folder (for Document Control and mobile markup) 7 Project Files Folder (for working files) 8 Upload Files 9 File Management Tools 10 Search 11 Files (click to view) 12 File Version 13 Files Metadata File Viewer Interface Click on a Revit file in Document Management to view: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1 Markups 2 Issues 3 RFIs 4 Sheets & Views 5 History 6 Phases 7 Levels 8 Markup Tools 9 Navigation Tools 10 Measure 11 Compare Versions 12 Element Properties Check Your Publish Settings Before publishing your file, check your Publish Settings on the Collaborate tab to include your sheet views and any 3D views when the file is published. Using sheets sets is an efficient way to combine your drawings. Creating Markups in the File Viewer When reviewing your published sheets in the file viewer, take advantage of the markup tools. These are visible to anyone. How Do I Markup a Drawing or 3D View on BIM360? Linking Files (CAD and Revit) All files to be linked into Revit, including CAD, non-collaborated Revit models, etc, should be uploaded as “Upload Linked Files”. Link files will be copied to your laptop using Autodesk Desktop Connector. How Do I link or reload a CAD file from BIM360 in Revit? How do I Upload A New CAD or Other Files To BIM360 Before Linking It Into Revit? Desktop Connector The Autodesk Desktop Connector is a required app for BIM360, and is useful for linking CAD files located on BIM360 to your cloud model files. This app puts a BIM360 drive within Windows File Explorer. Do NOT open Revit model files from there for editing.",

All opportunities that the firm has leads on or pursues should have a fee for the firm.  When we are in pursuit and are unsure of the value we are looking for the scale of the pursuit.   Is it $50,000 or $500,000 or $5,000,000 or $50,000,000?  You don’t need to be exact but be in the ballpark related to the size of the effort for the type of building and design efforts.  We also don’t pursue work we don’t have any chance of winning, so although our chances might be small (especially on earlier stages) it is never 0% chance of winning (otherwise why would be trying to pursue it). How do I delete an opportunity? First, you should know that once we have been awarded a project and the stage is Pending Start or a later stage that we display the same record in the Project app so the option to delete won’t be in the interface anymore.   You will need to reach out to the development team with the feedback button to figure out how we will clean up records at that point.   Prior to that if you enter something in error or a duplicate entry is created, you can find the delete button in the list view on the very right of the opportunity row for your pursuit in a dropdown menu found in the … menu. Should we enter everything into Pipeline that will become a project? Every significant potential design engagement should be entered into the app with basic information.   As much as you can we want to get everything, even direct selections entered first into pipeline before they move into the project app as an active project.   Of course, there will be some exceptions to this, but they should be the smallest efforts that don’t start in the pipeline app first for various reasons but will still be created in the Project app. How do I see the PMTK? In the info page under the action drop-down at the top, you can enable the PMTK to be used for your pursuit. Where can I find our hit rate? The actions drop-down you can find at the top of the app allows you to open a hit rate chart and filter for your studio. Why is my project at the bottom of the list under Misc in the Marketing meeting view? When grouping by clients we only group those that have 3 or more open pursuits.   All other entries get grouped at the bottom under Misc. PWU Training Videos All 16 / Pipeline 16 Page 1 of 2 1 2",

    "content": "Scroll to next section Scroll to next section AreaSync Rhino Documentation Area Sync Rhino is a tool for keeping track of building program and room’s schedule. It attaches data to geometries and provide quick feedback for designers in regards to areas and parameters. You can import a program from an Excel spreadsheet or just start sketching your areas using 3D or 2D geometries. We built a few guides to help you get started and speed up your projects. If you have any issues with getting things setup for your project, reach out on the Digital Practice MS Team (General channel). Rhino Working with 3D Let’s cover how to work with massings in Area Sync. We’ve prepared a sample file to follow along with which you can download below. Download Area Sync Rhino Example File Installing Area Sync Rhino To install Area Sync Rhino , go through the following steps: Open the Rhino Package Manager by typing the command PackageManager or through the top bar menu. Search for “ AreaSync ”. If AreaSyncRhino is not showing up on the search, please follow the guide below. Choose the latest version, or any older if that’s the case. Press install. Did it not show up? Setup the Perkins&Will Rhino Package Manager Open the options panel using the Options command. Navigate to the Advanced section on the left menu. Type PackageManager on the search bar. Double-click the “Value”. Make sure to include “;S:\\Yak” to the end of the sources. Did the Install Work? Make sure the installation worked out by opening the Area Sync panel using the AreaSyncRhinoPanel command. If you can see the Area Sync panel, you’re ready to get started. Import Example file Download the Area Sync Rhino Example file above. Import the file to Rhino. Sketch your parameters and get started Before anything, think about what parameters the client or your team wants to keep control. Some examples are if you want to break your program in departments, or space functions, if they are public or not, how many desks a space need to fit. On this guide we will be modelling the following problem: In this example we are gonna use 4 parameters (of 3 different types) : Department ( category ) Building ( category ) Public ( yes/no ) Target amount of desks ( number ) When you open the file, make sure you can see the Area Sync panel by typing the Rhino command “AreaSyncRhinoPanel”. Your screen should look like this: Define your parameters Now, click on “ Start Setup” and let’s start by defining the parameters we will keep track for this project. Area Sync comes with a few default parameters out of the box, and allow you to add parameters , which we will do just now. Go ahead and click “Add Parameters” . A parameter requires a name and a type. Area Sync supports 4 types of parameters: Text – Useful to give name to things, or specify details. Number – Assign quantities, minimums, maximums, targets, etc. Yes/no – Specify “true/yes” or “false/no” conditions. Category – Classify things like departments, type of buildings, type of space, etc. Create the Department parameter by inserting “ Department ” on the name and “ Category ” on the type. Parameters of type category require a set of values (or classes) to categorize things. Let’s insert the following departments: Retail, Office and Residential. You can also assign colors for each of these, by clicking the “green” square and picking a color. Let’s go ahead and create the other parameters: Building (category), Public (yes/no), Target amount of desks (number). After that, your parameter set should look like this: When you’re done, click next and let’s assign our parameters to our geometries. Assign parameters to geometry Now we’re gonna apply our parameter set to our volumes geometry in Rhino. You just need to select the geometries you want to be considered as rooms and click “Select Geometry”. At this step, you can also apply some values to parameters by using the “Assign Parameters”, this will be applied to all the geometries being hooked. We will skip this for now. Log in, select project and sync Sign in with your microsoft account 2. Select a project. 3. No projects to select? Reach out to the teams channel and ask a admin user to add you to a project. 3. Sync Review your rooms After creating your rooms, you get redirected to the Rooms table. Click on the “Home” icon to go to the home view. You can already view what is the total area of your project. To inspect rooms, you can select the geometry on the Rhino viewport. Assign values to parameters Let’s start assigning the values for our “Building” parameter. Still on the “Home” view, Select all the rooms on Building A On the panel, select the “Building A” value for the Building parameter. Do the same for Building B. This is the quickest way of assigning values to rooms, but you can also use the Table to edit your rooms. Let’s do that for the Public parameter. Go to the Table view. Select all the Public rooms. Click the edit button. Assign “yes” on the Public parameter. By default, “yes/no” parameters are initialized as “no” so you can skip setting the non-public rooms. Use your preferred method to assign the rest of the values according to the proposed problem on the beginning of the guide. Visualize your data Go to the Visualization view and check your data. You can view summaries and charts for your category parameters. You can also activate coloring to display the colors you assigned to the parameters and help understanding. Clicking on the chart slices or on the table rows will quickly select the elements of that category. It is also possible to export the chart and table by using the Print icon on the page. Edit table in visualization tab Go to Visualization page Click the edit button Hide/Show columns and rows Click edit icon to update table Target areas and coverage Target area is the parameter that drives the coverage. In the case your room must have a desired area, the Coverage parameter will calculate how much your room is different from your target. Try selecting all your rooms and assigning 200 sqm. as the target area for all of them. Then, go to the visualization tab. The coverage will be summed up by the category, and you can easily see if you are above or below target. You can also check on the Table view, the coverages individually for each room. It looks like the Residential and Office are below the target. Let’s fix that by editing our geometry and adding more rooms. Editing your geometry To meet the targets let’s resize the Offices. Area Sync automatically adjusts all the rest for us and we get instant feedback on our changes. You can also add new rooms by copying previous ones. Design Options Go to Options from the home screen Select a name for the option Select geometry from layer or category Save Want to see what you synced? Go to settings and “Use Mantle” Tags Turn tags on/off in the home screen Go to settings Tag settings Change size, color, and what to display on the tag Export to excel You can export your data to Excel by going to the Settings tab and using the “Export program” functionality. This is useful for data checking and performing more advanced operations.",

    "content": "Scroll to next section Scroll to next section Matterport for Architectural Scanning The Matterport PRO is a high-resolution 3D camera designed to capture the physical dimensions of a space with precision using a combination of LiDAR and photogrammetry. This technology generates a comprehensive 3D point cloud, offering numerous benefits for architectural applications: Virtual Tours Matterport’s 3D models enable the creation of immersive virtual tours, ideal for: Showcasing properties to clients and stakeholders. Enhancing presentations with interactive, walkthrough experiences. As-Built Documentation Matterport’s 3D models provide accurate as-built documentation, useful for: Verifying construction projects against specifications. Identifying and addressing issues in existing structures. Planning renovations or repairs with precise spatial data. Space Planning Matterport’s 3D models support efficient space planning by: Helping design teams optimize layouts for functionality and aesthetics. Facilitating informed decision-making for renovations and reconfigurations. Integrating Matterport  into your architectural practice enhances accuracy, improves client engagement, and streamlines project workflows. 3D Scans and Point Clouds Explained A 3D scan creates a digital model of a physical space using technologies like LiDAR and photogrammetry. It captures precise dimensions and details. A point cloud is a collection of data points that represent the surface of an object or space in three dimensions. It’s like a digital map made of dots, generated from 3D scans. Matterport uses LiDAR to create high-resolution 3D scans and point clouds, perfect for accurate architectural planning and design.

To begin, contact your local Digital Practice Manager to obtain equipment and detailed instructions. Refer to the User Guide below for further guidance on using the equipment. Previous Previous Previous Next Next Next How do I use Matterport PRO 2? To begin, contact your local Digital Practice Manager to obtain equipment and detailed instructions. Refer to the User Guide below for further guidance on using the equipment. Previous Previous Previous Next Next Next Quick Guide to Scanning Spaces with Matterport Preparation Plan Your Scan Choose a starting point and plan your path to cover the entire area efficiently. Ensure good lighting. Clear the Space Remove obstacles and clutter. Open all doors and ensure clear pathways. Scanning Process Camera Placement Position the camera at eye level (around 5 feet or 1.5 meters). Place the camera in the center of each room to capture the widest angle. Distance Between Scan Points General Indoor Spaces : 5 to 8 feet (1.5 to 2.5 meters). Large Open Spaces : Up to 10 feet (3 meters). Narrow or Complex Areas : 3 to 5 feet (1 to 1.5 meters). Scan Overlap Ensure at least 30% overlap between scan points. Maintain a clear line of sight between each scan point. Detail Scanning Take additional scans for intricate areas, ensuring multiple angles. Continuous Scanning Scan everything within a single building continuously. This avoids the need to connect different parts later and is more cost-effective since you only need to pay for the MatterPak once ($49 per space). Post-Scanning Review the Scan Use the Matterport Capture app to review and ensure all areas are covered. Re-scan areas with missing data or alignment issues. Define Mirror and Glass Areas After the scan, you will receive an option to define areas with mirrors and glass, which helps the software recognize and correctly process these reflective surfaces, reducing errors in the final model. Upload to the Cloud Connect your device to a WiFi network. Upload the scans to the Matterport Cloud. Contact Digital Practice Manager Once the scans are uploaded, contact your Digital Practice Manager to obtain links to visualize the 3D scan. If you need a Point Cloud, request the MatterPak package ($49 per space). How do I get the Point Cloud into Revit?

    "content": "Heuristics means “an approach to problem solving or self-discovery using a calculated guess.” Diversity breeds innovation. As a part of Perkins&Wills Digital Practice group Kart Gopinath (Vancouver) and Chance Heath (Washington DC) understand the necessity of innovating and applying new workflows to practice. Our proposal was to cultivate diversity by exploring the heuristics of other industries. By engaging in how other vocations transition from ideation to actualization we hoped to glean structures, methods, processes, tools, and technology architecture might adopt to improve our design approach. Our research resulted in nine different interviews ranging from a variety of industries. There were many key takeaways, but the most enlightening involved people. Good communication, relationships, and collaboration make any process more approachable. Combine these with the principles of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion and any problem can be overcome. EPISODE 1: Costume Design Joe Salasovich is the Costume Director at Arena Stage (a theater in Maryland). He and his team build, produce, and or design the ‘stories’ that are worn during the various productions. Joe’s insight on how to stay nimble when there are so many different variables, considerations, and different circumstances was extremely insightful. He provided multiple examples of workflows and techniques to stay organized but also inclusive. Arena-Stage-Joe EPISODE 2: Project Management and Technical Engineering Justine Le is incredible. She has two separate positions at Procter&Gamble; she’s both a Project Manager and a Technical Engineer. Justine’s roles demands she maintain a careful scrutiny of the effects of her decisions. With grace and genuineness, she navigates tackling challenging problems and difficult questions. Whether it’s tracking down who is the right person to answer her question or the right process for the job she has great insight on how to be both practical and creative. PG-Justine EPISODE 3: Drone Engineering Alex Luecke knows his field. With a background in aerospace engineering, he is soaring to new heights in his role at Amazon with their Prime Air initiative. A device so many different complex variables and concerns requires a high level of attention to detail and rigor in the process used to approach both design and production. Learn how Alex balances the multiple factors that effect the design of a complex process and what that means for him and his team. Prime-Air-Alex EPISODE 4: VFX Compositing Daniel Lang is no stranger to intense and demanding deadlines. His job requires perfection but also must be finished when it’s time to be done. As a compositor, he’s one of the final stops before the shots he works on go to editing. Learn how Daniel’s attention to detail and rigorous craft result in beautifully complex orchestrations of effort, color, talent, technology, and digital, and physical effects all in one five-second clip. VFX-Artist-Daniel EPISODE 5: Justice Equity Diversity Inclusion Kart and Chance realize their process lacks diversity. This episode is dedicated to their discussion about the issue and their process for interviewing. Although there is no clear solution part of the resolution can be found in having open and honest conversations about JEDI. EPISODE 6: Environmental Consulting Hannah Schriber is directly tackling some of the most challenging issues of our time – climate change. Her work helps educate her clients while providing solutions and steps they can take to create, not only a better product but a better planet. Hear how Hannah addresses important issues with discernment and tack to the benefit of everyone involved. AECOM-Hannah EPISODE 7: Satellite Engineering Ivan Vu has a challenging job, making things that work in outer space. Fortunately, the challenges associated with working in space are equally exciting. Ivan and his team coordinate in their process and communication to create something that must operate without faults (pun intended). Learn how boundaries and clear communication help everyone involved even if it means being direct and to the point. Northrop-Grumman-Ian EPISODE 8: Digital Fabrication Pat Colgan creates physical things for digital information; there’s a certain magic to that translation. Although the machines he uses directly assist with that process there is a level of labor and craft necessary to make the products Pat’s clients request. Learn how Pat leverages his passion for tackling abstract problems in creative ways to provide a balanced service and desired product to their customers. Plastec-Pat EPISODE 9: UX Design Ian Black cares about his users. Ian uses metrics, data, and intuition to build websites that are easy to navigate, visually appealing, and exceed his client’s expectations. Learn how Ian harnesses good data to drive good design and create an experience that is both fun and easy to use. UX-Designer-Ian EPISODE 10: Systems Engineering Matthew McGovern used his passion for architecture to pivot into a different space, outer space. His career is now centered on rockets and satellites. Matthew understands a good process requires excellent coordination, but he also sees value in remaining small and agile. Learn how an engineer tackles extremely difficult problems using data, process-driven design, and systems thinking. NOVI-Matthew A Final Thank You Kart and I would like to extend our gratitude and gratefulness to all our subject matter experts and to the Perkins&Will Innovation Incubator committee. This has been a rewarding an experience with lessons that will hopefully grow beyond our own experiences and affect the way some of our teams approach work in the future. Thank you.",

This will help to reduce the amount of data that needs to be loaded into the VR experience and improve performance. You can also use Enscape’s visibility settings to hide objects that are not visible from the VR perspective. Use scope boxes to limit the amount of model data that is loaded into the VR experience. This will help to reduce the load on your computer and ensure that the VR experience runs smoothly. Export Enscape to an executable (.exe) file to improve performance and reduce the load on your computer. This will allow you to run the VR experience as a standalone application, without requiring Enscape to be open in your modeling software. Check the strongest USB-C port of the laptop and try to use the one with higher data transmission capability. This will ensure that the VR experience runs smoothly and doesn’t lag or stutter due to data transfer issues. High-speed Wi-Fi network If using the Air link ensure that your device is connected to a high-speed Wi-Fi network. This will help to minimize latency and ensure that the VR experience is responsive and immersive. Reduce the render quality Reduce the render quality from Enscape’s (or another render) settings to draft mode, as this will reduce the load on your computer’s GPU and improve performance. You can still achieve a high-quality VR experience, even in draft mode. To Increase Quality Recommended to large projects Install Steam App Download and install Steam App in your computer. 💡 Please call IT  or Digital Practice to complete this step. https://store.steampowered.com/app/250820/SteamVR/https://www.meta.com/dk/en/quest/setup/?utm_source=www.meta.com&utm_medium=dollyredirect Sign-in to Steam App Sign-in into Steam Account Use local login and password if your office has one or create a new Steam account with your own e-mail Login: Password: Install Steam VR Search for Steam VR inside Steam App an install it with your Digital Practice Manager 💡 Please call IT  or Digital Practice to complete this step Keep Steam App and Steam VR Open Make sure to have Steam App and Steam VR open (only minimized) before starting VR experience You have to see this windows of Steam VR running Sign in Kuula Check for a license with the Digital Practice Team. https://kuula.co/about Upload panoramic views Create a project and upload 360 images from Enscape, Lumion, Matterport, or others.

Hub365 is an integrated ecosystem of data about our projects and people. Each app is designed to display only the relevant bits of information on a specific topic, or tools to complete a specific task. Everyone Basic suite of apps that everyone has access to. Some are personal apps designed to display data for/about you . All employees will have access to these apps. You may notice limited functionality in some apps. This is controlled by permissions based on your role at the firm. Finance Available to the Finance department and select individuals Operations Available to Ops Directors and select individuals Check out our Detailed Help Documentation FAQ Why can’t I edit PMTK? By default, the managing principal and project manager are the project admins that can edit the project. These roles are defined in Deltek Info Center by the finance department. In addition, studio leadership (Managing Director, Operations Director, and Finance team members) can edit the PMTK for their studios projects. Any of these existing projects admins can add another team member to be a project admin in order to edit the PMTK. How do I view Staffing across multiple projects? Look for a separate app called Studio Staffing . If it is not visible in the Hub Launchpad please reach out to your Ops Director to request access. Why can’t I choose specific start/end dates for my project? Budget, Schedule, and Staffing are all interconnected in the PMTK so our data streams have been simplified. Planning to the day (high level of detail) adds complexity and is not required at project scale.  We want to think about planning our people by weeks and not down to the day at the schedule level. How do I submit feedback or report bugs? Please use the Feedback button to report bugs, request a feature, or general comments. The Feedback button is seen in all areas of Hub365. Be descriptive and include screenshots when submitting. This will allow us to resolve issues directly and rollout fixes in real-time. How do I delete a phase from my project? Toggle Content goes here How do I remove a team member from my project? Toggle Content goes here Is there a mobile app? We do not have a standalone app (yet). Most of our apps are functional on mobile and will be improving in future updates. Right now, you can create a new project and even request a Vision number from your phone!

    "content": "On this guide, we will cover how to work with volumes (or massings) with Area Sync. We have prepared a sample problem and you just need to make sure to have Area Sync installed and to download the sample Rhino file provided below. Download Sample Rhino (3dm) file. Sketch your parameters and get started Before anything, think about what parameters the client or your team wants to keep control. Some examples are if you want to break your program in departments, or space functions, if they are public or not, how many desks a space need to fit. On this guide we will be modelling the following problem: On this example we are gonna use 4 parameters (of 3 different types) : Department (category) Building (category) Public (yes/no) Target amount of desks (number) Download and open the sample file here: When you open the file, make sure you can see the Area Sync panel by typing the Rhino command “AreaSyncRhinoPanel”. Your screen should look like this: Define your parameters Now, click on “ Start Setup” and let’s start by defining the parameters we will keep track for this project. Area Sync comes with a few default parameters out of the box, and allow you to add parameters , which we will do just now. Go ahead and click “Add Parameters” . A parameter requires a name and a type. Area Sync supports 4 types of parameters: Text – Useful to give name to things, or specify details. Number – Assign quantities, minimums, maximums, targets, etc. Yes/no – Specify “true/yes” or “false/no” conditions. Category – Classify things like departments, type of buildings, type of space, etc. Create the Department parameter by inserting “ Department ” on the name and “ Category ” on the type. Parameters of type category require a set of values (or classes) to categorize things. Let’s insert the following departments: Retail, Office and Residential. You can also assign colors for each of these, by clicking the “green” square and picking a color. By now your parameter set should look like this: Let’s go ahead and create the other parameters: Building (category), Public (yes/no), Target amount of desks (number). After that, your parameter set should look like this: When you’re done, click next and let’s assign our parameters to our geometries. Assign parameters to geometry Now we’re gonna apply our parameter set to our volumes geometry in Rhino. You just need to select the geometries you want to be considered as rooms and click “Select Geometry”. At this step, you can also apply some values to parameters by using the “Assign Parameters”, this will be applied to all the geometries being hooked. We will skip this for now. Review your rooms After creating your rooms, you get redirected to the Rooms table. Click on the “Home” icon to go to the home view. You can already view what is the total area of your project. To inspect rooms, you can select the geometry on the Rhino viewport. Assign values to parameters Let’s start assigning the values for our “Building” parameter. Still on the “Home” view, Select all the rooms on Building A On the panel, select the “Building A” value for the Building parameter. Do the same for Building B. This is the quickest way of assigning values to rooms, but you can also use the Table to edit your rooms. Let’s do that for the Public parameter. Go to the Table view. Select all the Public rooms. Click the edit button. Assign “yes” on the Public parameter. By default, “yes/no” parameters are initialized as “no” so you can skip setting the non-public rooms. Use your preferred method to assign the rest of the values according to the proposed problem on the beginning of the guide. Visualize your data Go to the Visualization view and check your data. You can view summaries and charts for your category parameters. You can also activate coloring to display the colors you assigned to the parameters and help understanding. Clicking on the chart slices or on the table rows will quickly select the elements of that category. It is also possible to export the chart and table by using the Print icon on the page. Target areas and coverage Target area is the parameter that drives the coverage. In the case your room must have a desired area, the Coverage parameter will calculate how much your room is different from your target. Try selecting all your rooms and assigning 200 sqm. as the target area for all of them. Then, go to the visualization tab. The coverage will be summed up by the category, and you can easily see if you are above or below target. You can also check on the Table view, the coverages individually for each room. It looks like the Residential and Office are below the target. Let’s fix that by editing our geometry and adding more rooms. Editing your geometry To meet the targets let’s resize the Offices. Area Sync automatically adjusts all the rest for us and we get instant feedback on our changes. You can also add new rooms by copying previous ones. Export to excel You can export your data to Excel by going to the Settings tab and using the “Export program” functionality. This is useful for data checking and performing more advanced operations.",

These sessions will again provide you with awareness and knowledge on how to do many day-to-day tasks of a design team as well as provide AIA continuing education credits.  Knowing the workload most teams and designers have right now we have organized the schedule down to a single week to focus on some important topics . We will look back on topics such as BIM360 Model Coordination, Lumion, and the Project App.  We will showcase a few new topics on Wind Comfort, Task Automation, and AreaSync.  We also hone in on our Carbon and Energy goals with two Architecture 2030 sessions and a look at tallyCAT. All of these sessions are now also being complemented by ongoing hands-on workshops we are calling Digital Practice Lab eXchange.   These labs will take all the same subjects and try to give you some real examples to click through and learn various subjects.   Look for these classes happening in the new PWU General channel. See past class recordings as well as upcoming workshops here . The Digital Practice eXchange i s an educational series hosted by Perkins&Will’s Digital Practice department for the exchange of ideas, information, knowledge, and expertise .

    "content": "BS8541 – Family Naming This is the extract from the BS that we need to adhere to A library object should be published in a format that enables the transfer of information, both person-to-person (human readable) and application-to-application. The object should be named to identify the origination (source or manufacturer), object type, and product or subtype. The name should use the _ underscore character as the delimiter and use CamelCase (no spaces, and capitalized words) to simplify phrases. No spaces or other punctuation should be used. NOTE 1 For example, a construction object might be named “NBL_LightFixture _CeilingPendant”. Family naming and categorization is extremely important in: Helping users efficiently find proper families to use Organizing the large amount of information that goes into different schedules (IE. Furniture Schedules) Ensuring management of a large / reusable family library that does not exceed our family limit of 1MB per family Working with different drawings filters SOURCE: PWA REVIT CATEGORY: ONLY REVIT CATEGORY LIST SUBTYPE: SHORT CONCISE SUB CATEGORY (TRY TO STICK TO EXISTING) DESCRIPTION: SHORT DESCRIPTION, SOMETHING THAT DIFFERENTIATES THE FAMILY FROM OTHERS THAT ARE SIMILAR BUT NOT A NOVEL!

    "content": "ISO19650 – Digital Naming Protocol UK National Annex to BS EN ISO 19650‑2:2018 – Information container identification (ID) ISO19650‑2:2018 states: ‘The project’s common data environment shall enable each information container to have a unique ID, based upon an agreed and documented convention [comprising] fields separated by a delimiter’. In the UK, the unique ID for project file information containers within a common data environment (CDE) should be defined using all the fields shown in Figure NA.1 in the order shown, separated by a delimiter and used in its entirety as a single unique string. Field codes within the file information container ID should be formed using only alphanumeric characters (capital and lower-case letters A–Z and digits 0–9). Figure NA.1 — Identification of file information containers within a common data environment The following image defines how we implement the above guidance.  This page does not attempt to resolve EVERY combination of container naming.  Projects may differ slightly and there is not really a one size fits all. For example a client may have a specific naming convention or a fit-out project may need to align with the shell and core contract.  For this reason each project will have this information fully documented in either the EIR , the Project Information Standard or included in the BEP . All we ask is DON’T JUST GUESS. Come chat to a Digital Practice person and we can ensure the files/containers are understood and added into the Digital Execution Plan document suite. The example below show how containers fields maybe formed. The example below shows how the classification field 7 is used at Perkins&Will to define our sheet series types",

    "content": "ISO19650 – Status Codes and Revisions The magical world of ISO19650 Status Codes and Revisions Status codes are there to inform the recipient what they can use the information for, by highlighting its purpose and stage of development. Remember that the status code is really just a shortened metadata equivalent of its meaning e.g. “A4” can be used to accompany the purpose of issue – “Stage 4 complete – Suitable for construction”. This is so that you can present the A4 code a CDE solution, rather than having to show the whole thing “Stage 4 complete – Suitable for construction”. The table below gives the ISO standards status codes and what each code is used for. Bear in mind that this is guidance and there won’t be a one size fits all.  How status codes are implemented really needs to be define3d at the outset of the project and recorded in the BIM documentation suite.  Status codes may vary depending on procurement route or contract type. Revision wise do note that the standard limits us to P (Preliminary) and C (Contract) You can have of course have several revisions applied to the same file at the same status e.g. a drawing may be revised and reissued 10 times incrementally at S3 until its ready to move to S4 etc. All we ask is DON’T JUST GUESS.

Information on this page will guide you through the setup within the Revit addin, as well as how it connects to PowerBi. Area Sync Rhino is a tool for keeping track of building program and room’s schedule. It attaches data to geometries and provide quick feedback for designers in regards to areas and parameters. You can import a program from an Excel spreadsheet or just start sketching your areas using 3D or 2D geometries. We built a few guides to help you get started and speed up your projects. If you have any issues with getting things setup for your project, reach out on the Digital Practice MS Team (General channel). Which version of AreaSync do I need for my project? If you’re working with 3D forms in Rhino and tracking different design options, you’ll want to look at our AreaSync Rhino documentation . If you’re working with Revit and tracking Room and Area elements only , then AreaSync2 is the right tool for you. If you’re working in Revit and tracking family instances of masses, floors, walls, furniture, casework, etc. (along with rooms/areas), then AreaSync1 is what you should use. AreaSync Rhino AreaSync2 AreaSync1 Why are there multiple versions of AreaSync for Revit? Our first version of the AreaSync plugin in Revit provided us with a vast set of tools for pulling many different types of elements, and contains some fundamental tools to synchronize data between Excel and Revit. The AreaSync2 plugin is integrating this functionality in a streamlined user interface that is setup to be web-based. Currently, the AreaSync2 tool writes the area and room element data from the Revit files. Future development on the app will include syncing family instances from the Revit model.",

Don’t use @[channel name] all the time to get everyone’s attention.   Use it when you truly need everyone to see something. Don’t use inapporpriate emoji, stickers or gifs with your team members or co-workers. Don’t add channels for day to day conversations. Use threads for that, or private group chats (if a private chat is needed). Only add a channel for a long-term distinctly focused topic. Scroll to next section Scroll to next section Meeting Attendee Instructions Making sure our team members and clients are properly connected to our virtual meetings is one key step that often is problematic.   Below is a shorter and longer instruction list you can download and share with our external attendees joining a Teams meeting. Sharing and Working 2.0 FAQ What is the default folder template for project work? All projects will start out with the simplified version of DOCS and SPECS that was previously on the P drive.   This will begin for all new projects starting in May of 2022. How do I work with files if they are all in the cloud? You will need to use the sync feature for files in Teams.   This will create pointers to the cloud files through Onedrive on your laptop.   This needs to be setup individually by each team member on their own laptop each time you join a project. Should I save copies of anything back to the P drive for record keeping? All files will be stored in the cloud during the course of active design and construction for your project.   After close out when the client takes over the building IT will have a process to permanently move all files to the R drive for long-term storage and retrival.   The team will not need to worry about taking care of this. Should I just move all my files from the P drive to Teams then? We specifically looked at application functionality and technical benefits in making this decision.   The larger goal achieved is that Teams and SharePoint are part of the Microsoft cloud ecosystem and support Microsoft files online which gives our designers added value.   We do not get the same value by putting all files up there.  There was a logical divide in how our typical folders were already divided to make just this move.  There are also business cost implications that are not financially sound by moving all of our files to Teams beyond the technical hurdles or benefits. What files shouldn’t I put on Teams? We will continue to keep our Revit models and the related files for the models on the Autodesk BIM360 platform.   All existing content that would typically go to the Design folder on the P drive will remain there. Will my client see all my files on Teams? You should only be inviting your external team members including your client to the folders you want to share and not the entire MS Team.   If you have a more integrated need to work with external people, please consult with our Digital Practice team on the best setup for your specific project situation. How do I sync my files? There is a sync button at the top area of the files tab for your project.   This will utilize OneDrive on your laptop to create pointers to these files allowing you to open items up directly through windows explorer just as you did when navigating the P drive. How do I know where I should save my file? Please refer to the PDM for general instructions on our folder structure and how to use it and then coordinate with your team on the specifics of what your project is doing for the organization. How do I share my files with our project team’s consultants? Now that we are working in the cloud you don’t have to move the files anywhere in order to share them.   This will reduce the unnecessary need to copy and move files by using the share functionality of Teams/Sharepoint right from where the files exist.   This also allows you to share files in different ways with different parties allowing some to have view-only access while others you share editing access with. What do I need to do if I am inviting my client or contractor or engineer’s to my MS Team? In the situation where you need to invite people to the Microsoft Team, we need to move the private folder to a private channel for PW employees only, and the Design Team folder to a private channel that only PW+Consultants will be invited to.  The deliverables folder can stay under the general channel in Teams. FAQ Q: How many channels do most teams need? A: If you are not working with any external design partners, clients, or contractors you will want to keep your channels to a minimum to avoid making it difficult to find information in the future.   You can always create more as your project moves along once you find them being used.   Right now – Less is more. Q: Can I open another window of teams to work on multiple screens? A: Currently Teams is restricted to just one version on your desktop at a time but you can open another version through a web browser in Office 365.   You can however pop open as many chats as you want in a new window. Q: How can I sync or connect our P drive folder to our Microsoft Teams? A:  Currently there is no relationship between the two file repositories that can be made. Q: Are there any keyboard shortcuts? A: Yes, there is a whole list of shortcuts you can see here to speed up your use of the Teams.",

    "content": "PW London Learning The Digital Practice London Learning programme is a series of sessions exchanging ideas, information, knowledge, and expertise. They occur weekly in person in the office and give an opportunity for our local designers to come along with a laptop and follow along to hands on training sessions. We have planned a regular slot  at noon on a Wednesday . Sessions will typically last 30 minutes and will be in Room 4. The firm provides a series of training mediums with the majority of them online so these we are looking to provide face to face. To make this a success we need ongoing topics so please contact us with ideas and proposals. These sessions aim to be fairly informal rather fully prepared curated presentations. The table below highlights the topics up for discussion but look out for individual email invites that require a response so that we can estimate numbers. Click here to add your own text",

These sessions will again provide you awareness and knowledge on how to do many day-to-day tasks of a design team as well as provide AIA continuing education credits.  We have reorganized the typical schedule down to a single week to reduce the classes and focus on some important topics .  We will cover some topics on BIM360 now that everyone has been using it for some time.   We will showcase a few topics on design and analysis again.  Finally included more classes around using the best-in-class tools effectively for construction contract administration.   This core exchange will be supplemented by a keynote, panel discussion, and workshop from the AIA Technology in Architectural Practice Virtual Conference. Look for special links and registration for those sessions as they will not be on the PWU channel but are publicly available for all in our industry. All of these sessions are now also being complemented by ongoing hands-on workshops we are calling Digital Practice Lab eXchange.   These labs will take all the same subjects and try to give you some real examples to click through and learn various subjects.   Look for these classes happening in the new PWU General channel. See past class recordings as well as upcoming workshops here . The Digital Practice eXchange i s an educational series hosted by Perkins&Will’s Digital Practice department for the exchange of ideas, information, knowledge, and expertise .

Quality can vary a lot. For labor purposes, spray applicators and plasterers are in the same union and can take on both scopes. However, keep in mind that specifying spray applied only application and asking the spray applier to knockdown will not have the same quality results as having a plasterer do the work. What is shown in these images is a trowel grade (TG) cementitious product that is spray applied and then troweled smooth(ish). Maybe a multi-person operation and requiring skilled labor. 07 86 00 Smoke Seals Topic: Cold Smoke Seal at Window Wall to Prevent Passage of Fire Project Name: FIU Parkview Phase II Project Phase: Construction Project Team Member: Lincoln Linder Lessons Learned: Hilti Judgement Request #24063 states that at window wall condition, a cold smoke seal is sufficient to prevent the interior passage of flame. The judgement allows options for the use of three different Hilti sealants in the location where sealant and backer rod is shown our construction detail.

These sessions will again provide you awareness and knowledge on how to do many day-to-day tasks of a design team as well as provide AIA continuing education credits.  We have reduced the typical schedule down to complement innovation week and our ongoing lab exchange sessions .  We will cover some internal tools developed at the firm for our use as well as some more classes around using the best-in-class tools more effectively for construction contract administration.   We will complement our typical learning sessions with another keynote on robotics and BIM. All of these sessions are now also being complemented by ongoing hands-on workshops we are calling Digital Practice Lab eXchange.   These labs will take all the same subjects and try to give you some real examples to click through and learn various subjects.   Look for these classes happening in the new PWU General channel. See past class recordings as well as upcoming workshops here . The Digital Practice eXchange i s an educational series hosted by Perkins&Will’s Digital Practice department for the exchange of ideas, information, knowledge, and expertise . S essions are held weekly throughout the year, with two-week events each quarter. Th is quarter’s sessions are listed below . Click on any session to add it to your calendar.

Create a Property Group (formerly ‘Class’) with the properties you want to assign to your geometry. The example shows a space plan organized by department, but you can use any data scheme you like. We also have properties for the Floor Area and a special Shape property that we will discuss in a moment. Assign the property group to your Rhino geometry when complete. Select the geometry, give it a name and assign it a Department. Leave the Floor Area and Shape blank for now. The script will generate those values. Grasshopper Script Select the Rhino elements and ‘Set Multiple Breps’. The script uses the lowest surface of the Brep as the floor footprint. It calculates the area of that footprint and translates the shape into the Tracer .json format. Set the toggle to True and the parameter values are pushed back to the Semantic properties. Set the toggle back to False when you are finished. Now that all the Semantic properties have accurate values write the values out to an Excel spreadsheet by setting the other toggle to True. Excel will open and write the values. Set the toggle back to False when you are finished. Data in Excel matches the Grasshopper output. PowerBI Integration How does this get into PowerBI?",

What are Snippets? Snippets aim to enhance the design process in three ways: Automating existing, repetitive tasks – e.g. calculating areas or test fitting facade layouts on a massing model. Enabling new design workflows and processes – e.g. generating urban massing, terrain, or complex geometries. Augmenting design decision making, by providing continuous access to relevant data and documentation as an integrated part of working on designs in Rhino. This includes daylighting, visibility, parking requirements, etc. Enabling Collaboration and Sharing At SHL, we want to help facilitate collaboration by providing a way for us to share the benefits of our collected work. Many studios invest their own time automating complex or repetitive tasks. Sharing this work between studios or even employees locally has historically been difficult, which has inevitably entailed an unnecessary duplication of efforts. Therefore, we have developed a template and method that allows you to easily save your scripts in a format that can be added to our custom toolbar. This template, based on our years of collaboration in computational design, includes guidelines on how to layout your script and suggestions as to what to make visible to the end-user. We hope that this template will foster sharing and reuse amongst the computational designers at Perkins + Will, giving us access to a huge, consistent library of tools and an edge over our competitors. Notes Many of the Snippets have been developed to answer the requirements of specific projects, which means they have been tested on real-life scenarios and then refined to meet changing demands. When completing a project, a good rule of thumb is that you will need to spend an extra 20% of your time to turn the raw grasshopper script into an easily accessible tool. “Designing” the Snippet greatly influences the attractiveness and usability of the tool for those who are not experienced Grasshopper users. Even for experienced users, immediately knowing the purpose and value of a tool will influence the degree to which it is used. Snippets have helped us to optimise and augment our design process at SHL significantly – and we are just getting started! We hope that you will join us, share your ideas and help us to deliver differently across Perkins and Will.",

Install Rhino 7, the latest version of Climate Studio, and your newest graphics card driver, all available in Software Center. Run the Analysis Geometry Organize objects by layer so climate studio can assign materials.  Climate Studio works with open meshes, closed meshes, surfaces, and solids. Geometry can be imported from other programs (SketchUp, Revit, etc.) but you must check the fidelity of the resulting geometry. If you are having issues running an analysis the first thing to check is the quality of any imported geometry. Solids must have normals facing outward. Ground Plane Surrounding Context (Buildings, Trees, etc.) Analysis Surface (Must be <10,000SF) Opaque elements (Floors, Walls, etc.) Translucent elements (Glazing) Modeled as a single surface facing outward Select Simulation Choose ‘the LEEDv4 Option 2’ simulation Weather File Use an .epw file from near your project location. Materials & Glazing Initially, we will use default materials (that start with ‘LM’) that give a general idea of how your design performs but these must be updated with specific materials to achieve accurate final results before submitting for LEED credit(s). The Climate Studio panel to assign materials looks like this. Switch from the ‘Other’ library to ‘Glazing Assembly’ Use a default glazing around 0.6 Tvis (light transmittance) if you do not know your specific glazing. Analysis Grid If your floorplan is less than 10,000 SF you can analyze the entire floor as a single object. If it is larger you must create multiple individual areas to analyze. Each area should be a planar surface. The analysis grid is created at an offset (usually 30″) from the selected surface. Choose the sensor spacing. More sensors will take longer to process. Results and Next Steps Results THESE ARE PRELIMINARY RESULTS USING DEFAULT VALUES! THEY ARE NOT SUFFICIENT FOR LEED CREDITS! SET REAL MATERIALS AND GLAZING PRIOR TO LEED SUBMISSION! Contact Tyrone Marshall or post to the Performance Design Teams Channel to take your simulation to the next level and get real-world values out of your model. The results window will pop up when you press Play on the simulation. It shows the number of credits that would be awarded in a final simulation. The analysis plane in the Rhino viewport will be colored by the color band at the bottom of the results window.

    "content": "Rhino.Inside – Pass Geometry Rhino to Revit and Back Download Click Here to Download the Script Geometry Transfer Both Ways Click Here to Download the Script There are many ways to interact with your Revit and Rhino objects using Rhino.Inside. The first step is to select elements to operate on. Next, decide what you want to do with them. In this example, we are selecting all Revit elements of a single category (Floors). All floors (2) in Revit are passed out of the node. The yellow panel in the middle shows those elements (Revit Floor : Concrete). Every aspect of the Revit elements are available to be used or modified, including parameter values. In this example, we are simply extracting the element geometry (Closed Brep). Grasshopper holds data within nodes that are connected together to form a script. To make geometry available natively in Rhino or Revit it must be ‘baked’ into Rhino or put in Revit using ‘DirectShape’. Both functions are very simple to perform. See the image above. The Revit to Rhino process is shown in blue; Rhino to Revit in red. (The ‘Bake’ node is part of the Elefront plugin. It is optional. Right-click to bake any node.) There is much more that Rhino.Inside can do. We’re still exploring all of the options but wanted to get these basic workflows out to everyone and encourage you to explore more on your own. Reach out to Luc Deckinga or Mario Romero with any questions. How to Use Grasshopper in Revit We will have a one-click install for Rhino.Inside available soon in the software center. Until then download the latest Rhino.Inside build here . Close Rhino and Revit before installing, then restart Revit. OPEN REVIT FIRST! Rhino.Inside (and Grasshopper) must be launched from within Revit to connect the two environments. If you accidentally open Rhino separately the Rhino.Inside tools and menus will not appear in Grasshopper. Open Revit, Add-ins tab Rhino button Rhino Tab Grasshopper button Revit tab in Grasshopper There are many ways to interact with your Revit and Rhino objects using Rhino.Inside. The first step is to select elements to operate on. Next, decide what you want to do with them. Here is an example of selecting elements from the active Revit project by category and then extracting the geometry from those element, here two floor slabs. What is Rhino.Inside? Rhino.Inside breaks down the barriers between designing in Rhino and documenting in Revit. Without getting too technical, Revit, Rhino and Grasshopper are all running in the same ‘session’, which means the data in one is available to all others.  Open a Revit file. Open a Rhino file. Pass geometry and data back and forth using Grasshopper. We no longer need to export/import through a third-party file format and lose data in the translation.",

    "content": "PW Revit Tools Perkins + Will’s custom developed Revit tools can be found inside Revit on the Perkins + Will Tab. These tools were custom developed to work with the workflow that are specific to Perkins + Will. Project Create We have streamlined the process of project creation by providing Project Create. This tools will help you create new projects using our P+W Templates. To start a new project, use the “Project – Create” command under the Project Creator button. This will open the Create Project window. Step 1: Select a project template Select a template option from the drop down list. Templates are listed by Offices and some offices have special Market sector templates, Contact your local DA for office specific Templates. Firm-wide templates are general templates with common basic elements. Step 2 : Select a Save Option Select a save option from the three choices: BIM360, Network (P: drive) and Do Not Save Yet. BIM360 – save file to the local drive temporarily, before taking the next step to upload to BIM360, open MK card for Collaborate in Cloud for BIM360 . Network(P: drive) – saves to network, Sync to central and relinquish user created worksets, opens MK card on how to save a new Central File . Note: this option will be removed in Revit 2021 version. Do Not Save Yet – gives you the option to save later, if you are not sure what ti do. Open MK card automatically checkbox – uncheck to disable MK card from opening automatically. Step 3: Save Filename as … Fill out the text boxes that prompts for the Client name and Project Name, the tool will use these names to form the final file name (ClientName+ProjectName.RVT) as per our PDM standard. Step 4 – Save to File location Click the “Save To” button to specify the location that you want to save the file to. You can adjust the filename in this dialog box to suit your need. When you are ready to create the project, simply click on the “Create” button to start the process. This command will copy the selected template as a new project (and detach from central). Depending on the save option selected, it will save the file using the name you specified in the folder you selected. If you selected Do No Save Yet option, then you will need to save the project to a project location on the network as the new central file manually. The firmwide baseline template contains the minimum baseline settings and content that are deemed necessary for all teams. The Office specific template contains baseline content, basic annotation settings etc that each office has determined to be included in a starting project template. After clicking the “Create” button, you will need to wait a few seconds for the tool to create your new project. As soon as your project is created, you will see this notification window telling you that the project creation is now complete, Click OK to continue. The standard PW template file will look something like this: By default, the PW templates will contain only the basic content need, such as schedules, legends and details. For additional content and settings, please use Hive to import content as needed. “Browse” button: enables you to load various Templates from around the Firm . “Cancel” button: will close the window and exit the command. ? button: will open the MK card for “How Do I Create a New Revit Project?” Levels Levels Manager Window – batch create multiple levels and associated plan views. “Add Batch” – this button helps you to batch create levels. Simply specify how many levels you’d like to create, what prefix you’d like to call the levels, what number you want the new levels to start from, what elevation height the new level will be on, and the typical floor to floor height of the new levels. (use a typical floor to floor height for now, and you can resize later using the RESIZE tool if there is any non-typical floor height on some of the floors). Click on “Create Levels” to see a list of the levels. You can edit Level Names, and Shared Elev in this window as well. Click OK to save the changes. If you also want to create new Floor Plans and Reflected Ceiling Plans of the newly created levels, place a check mark on the last column of the levels that you want to create the views for. Click OK to create the views. Export level information to Excel – export existing level information to Excel format Import level information from Excel – Use the exported existing level information in Excel, add in new levels name and height information, then re-import that data back into Revit to create and adjust the levels inside Revit. Levels Resize Manager window: This is a tool to quickly batch adjust floor to floor height. Use Level Resize Manager to adjust floor to floor height of certain number of floors, while maintaining the existing floor to floor height of levels that are not changing. Import Legend Import Legends from PW Digital Practice on Vimeo . Password: DA Import Legend is a tool that helps you import legends from other Revit files. Click on the Browse button to specify the Revit file that you want to copy from, The tool will automatically extract a list of all the legends in the source file (note that it may take a while to load all the legend if the Revit file is very large). Then check and select the legends that you wish to import, and click on the “Import” button Note: Items in grey do not exist in your current (destination) file. Items that are not in grey already exist in your current file, and if you choose to import items that already exist in your file, then select the Duplicate Option on what you want to deal with the duplicate situation. Duplicates can either be renamed with a suffix (“-Duplicate”) or be ignored during the import process. Copy Sheets Copy Sheets is a tool to help you duplicate sheets within a Revit file, or bring in sheets from other Revit file. The default setting is to copy from your Current Revit File. Check and select the sheets that you want to duplicate, then click on the “Copy” button to copy the sheets. When a sheet is duplicated, everything on the sheet is also copied onto the new sheet. Viewports will be duplicated and given a new view name with a suffix at the end. When copying from another Revit file, sheets with details views, legends and schedules can be copied, but model views will not be able to be copied. Copy Views Copy Views is a tool to help you copy one or more views onto existing sheets. The typical use case is when you have a series of related sheets that all have the same standard layout, with the same legends, and notes or detail views placed in the same locations. Instead of manually placing them on each of these sheets, you would setup one sheet with all the elements placed correctly. Then select this typical sheet as the sample sheet, specify the views that you want to copy, then specify what sheets you want the views to be copied onto, then click “Copy” to start. View Genie The View Genie contains various tools that streamlines the view creation process, allowing you to batch create the views if you have a specific pattern that repeats, saving you precious time needed to create all your project views. View Genie > Duplicate Views For most projects, we often have a series of standard annotation views that we create for each floor plan. Use Duplicate Views to batch create annotations views with view templates. View Genie > Create Dependent Views Use Depedent Views to batch create a series of dependent views controlled by scope boxes. View Genie > Place Views on Sheet Place Views on Sheet does exactly what the name implies, except you can batch create many sheets each with a single Main view and a legend on each sheet (optional). View Genie > Batch Create Workset Views Batch Create Workset Views is a tool designed to help you setup views that contains a single visible workset, so your user can check and see if there is anything that is in the wrong workset. By default, the workset views will have the WKS_ followed by the workset name as the view name. The views will be created, and all the elements will be turned off, except for the elements in the workset of the same name. The “Update All Views” button will update the view visibility in case new elements were created and were turned on by default/ When new worksets are created, by default the element in those workset will be visible in all views. To fix that, the Update All Views button to automate the visibility update on all the workset views. For more info on View Genie, here is a video from the Shanghai office on View Genie. Update Doors Update Doors helps you batch change the door numbers to match the room numbers. Since doors are phase based, you need to first select a phase that doors are on. Next, you pick the Room Option which the door number will follow. “To Room” means the room that the door swings into, “From Room” is the room that the door opens from. Default is the “To Room” option. There are three ways to batch update the door numbers. By Level, Pre-Select Doors, and All Doors. By Level – select a level from the drop down list of levels, and all the door numbers on that level will be updated. Pre-selected Doors only – First you need to pre-select the doors that you want to change, then click on the Update Doors to use this option to update just the selected doors. This is a good option to update just a few doors. All Doors in Building – this will update all the doors that are in the file that are of the specified phase. Click “Update Door Number” to start the process. Tool Tips Tool Tips will open our PW Revit QuickStart Guide – https://digitalpractice.perkinswill.com/quickstarts/revit-quickstart/",

    "content": "CCA Modernization QuickStart Guide Applying Perkins&Will’s technology platform to age-old, analog Construction Contract Administration (CCA) processes, will enable us to streamline many arduous tasks. Over the course of the firm’s Deliver Different initiative, a team of experts from across the firm has studied and investigated our current CCA process with the charge of creating a more efficient and modern process. The assumed solution was to either replace or enhance the existing software application, Newforma. The expert team worked closely with Newforma as well as innovative project teams within the firm for well over 6 months. It was finally determined that the most effective solution was to neither replace nor enhance Newforma, but rather allow our technological advances to remove Newforma entirely . An ambitious plan is being put into action beginning in August to modernize not only our CCA process but also Project Information Management (PIM). Teams currently relying on Newforma in the CCA phase can continue as planned without interruption if they complete their project by June 2022; however, no new Newforma projects will be created. Also, any projects with construction lasting past June of 2022 will need to plan a transition to the new tools and workflows.  Instead, we will work with project teams to prepare and transition to our new processes. Training, best practices, and supporting collateral will be documented and published throughout August on this QuickStart Guide. Below you will find the overall project schedule, key new workflows, and a compilation of Frequently Asked Questions. A virtual Town Hall was held on August 5th and was the first step of the conversation of modernizing our project information management and construction contract administration. If you were not able to make it, check out the recording. We will continue to add more answers to our FAQ on this page, as well as some more resources on the technical specifics on how to proceed on the many processes we are talking about moving into. Please reach out to us with any questions in the Digital Practice , Technical Design or Project Management Teams pages. Schedule / FAQ File Transfer RFI’s Submittals Project Email Field Observations Previous Previous Previous Next Next Next 2022 Plan The second phase of the modernization plan kicked off this year. Many of the related tasks revolve around project teams, working with them to adapt to new work processes. The new solutions are designed to be a flexible framework to accommodate and better adapt to our various practice areas and project sizes. Overburdening projects with unnecessary processes are against the initiative’s goal of becoming hyper-efficient. Frequently Asked Questions Will I still be able to access past projects? All the data generated or filed with Newforma is accessible on the P: drive, in the project folder.   All Newforma specific data will be stored on our servers and have specific access points when requested. Will there be internal training? Yes, Core eXchange sessions and Lab exchange sessions will be held in the coming weeks. This QuickStart guide will evolve  and new microKnowledge cards created. We have existing microKnowledge cards and Core eXchange session recordings focused on BIM360 and Microsoft Teams. These recordings and cards will be curated into a library. If you have a need for specific instructional material, please contact your local Design Applications Manager. Is there any change in Newforma support for projects that remain? Newforma support will remain available if we have active projects on the platform. Utilize our Digital Practice Teams channels, Digital Practice office hours, or our helpdesk support email for technical problems. Will someone reach out to our project team and ask us if we are willing to transition away from Newforma or is it out of our hands? We would prefer to transition projects away from Newforma, so Digital Practice will contact your team to determine if that is a good option. If your project requires its use for construction contract administration, and your team is happy with the current Newforma workflow, you can keep using it until project completion. If you are interested in moving away from Newforma, your local Digital Practice will be able to answer any questions about other tools for use. I really liked using Newforma, can I keep using it? Projects starting in August 2021 will not have Newforma available and only projects that started CCA before this date will continue to have Newforma access after we sunset our regular use. Please discuss alternative software platforms with your Design Applications Manager to replace Newforma functionality that you like. Is there an application that will replace Newforma? We will be using several existing tools which we have found to be better at the individual task Newforma used to cover. Nothing new is being added. Is there anything I need to do to my Digital Execution Plan or my General Division Specs? Digital Execution Plans should always describe the tools and process for completing project work so continue to do this. Division 1 new language is being written right now by Technical Directors, our Legal group, and our specifications writers to require GC/CM’s to provide construction management software for our projects and to provide the design team with access to it. Please coordinate this with your Technical Director for projects currently in the design phases. If a client requires Newforma for a particular project, is that an option as a project cost or office cost? The current licensing model for Newforma does not lend itself to this scenario. A future cloud version of Newforma is under development and may become a solution. In the meantime we can work with Newforma to review solutions. How do I keep track of my project team (and other project management tasks)? The Microsoft platform provides several ways to do this, one option is a simple excel spreadsheet shared in the Teams project. Please contact your Digital Practice Team member to discuss options. GC is requiring Newforma, do we have to comply, and will Digital Practice be able to support those teams? In most contract situations we do not answer to the GC. We can have a discussion on the best process and practice with both our client and the contractor. Digital Practice supports whatever tools teams are using. We do however have recommendations for best practices that might not align with your selected tools. What will replace Info Exchange? SharePoint/Teams/OneDrive/BIM360 can share files with external parties. BIM360 also can share files, of any format, with external parties. Anyone can create a BIM360 login for free. I am working on construction contract administration on my project right now in Newforma, when will it stop working? If you are happy with your current Newforma workflow, you can keep doing what you’re doing until the project is complete and closed out. If, however, you and your team would like to transition away from Newforma, you can do so at any time by contacting your local Design Applications Manager. Is BIM360 an option for CCA activities? We can leverage some of BIM360s Document Management tools for certain field activities, but it is not intended to replace the constructor’s construction management system. We will not be using BIM360s Construction Management’s modules. Newforma is a single software solution, how many platforms will I need to go when Newforma is not available for RFIs, submittals, change orders, punchlist? We don’t anticipate the need to use more than 1 or 2 software platforms, and these will typically be platforms you are already using. Please talk to your Technical Director and Design Applications Manager to develop a project-specific plan. Does filling in the gap with 2 or 3 other pieces of software meet the industry standard of care for CCA? Tools do not define the standard of care; they are merely our instruments of service. Our activities and the outcomes define it. File Transfer Microsoft SharePoint will be the underlying platform for transferring most large files. Sharepoint can accommodate individual file transfers or entire project folder structures, to collaborate with sub-consultants, GC/CM, trade partners and clients. BIM360 is the platform for sharing and collaborating with Revit Files, BIM360 can be further extended for document management. Together, these systems are highly adaptable for our teams deliverables. Overall file management is an evolving ecosystem as more software relies on their cloud systems to extend functionality. Our Perkins&Will systems will continue to adapt. The current recommendation is that while collaborating on “live” files, utilize the platform, ie BIM360, Office 365, Miro, etc. When a document is issued than the corresponding file should be archived in the “P” drive. Frequently Asked Questions How do I create transmittals for file transfers? The e-mail we use to send the file link and/or the log from Microsoft Office 365 can be utilized as a transmital. What about doing a transmittal for physical items we are sending someone? We have a template in word that can be utilized for the situations where it is needed because the process is not digital in exchanging information. RFI’s The process of double-logging RFI’s is coming to an end! A thorough review of how most our CM/GC partners use Construction Management systems allows us to download or request an editable log on demand. These CM/GC-generated logs typically provide all the information we need as a project record and to keep track of RFIs. If your CM/GC partner is not on a modern system we have recommendations for them and/or can provide a RFI log template we can utilize through Office 365. A template has been created that you can download for excel from the image below to use to capture log information for most CCA activities. CCA Log CCA Log Consultant Tracking Only Frequently Asked Questions Where do we do our double-entry of construction activities? Our current tools and processes and those used by our constructor partners have made the double-entry of CCA information obsolete and unnecessary. In most scenarios, we can rely on the RFI, and submittal logs created by the constructor’s construction management software. When this is the case, the team must download and save these logs regularly (weekly at a minimum) as part of the project file. If this is not possible, please discuss with your Technical Director and Design Applications Manager to develop a project-specific plan. We are required to log information during construction as part of our contract, how will I do that now? There is no single solution to this question, but we acknowledge that this is still necessary to keep records of what is happening during construction on your project. Most scenarios will involve using the platform the contractor provides to track submittals and RFIs and then downloading a report or log from these web platforms weekly (or more frequently if your projects warrant it) to keep for our records. If necessary, we will supplement those downloads with our own notes or adjusted records if we do not feel like the information contained in them is correct. Please contact your Technical Director to formulate a process for your project. Will we need to manually create logs, and manually file all of construction contract administration correspondence now? Please continue to file all construction contract administration e-mail correspondence but use the new shared project folders. For logs, we can generally rely on the logs created by the constructor’s construction management software and do not need to recreate our own. Please note that this will require that we download and save submittal and RFI logs regularly (weekly is the minimum frequency.) Please talk to your Technical Director to develop a process and workflow for your project that meets the project needs and our contractual obligations. How do I create transmittals for RFIs and Submittals? Most of the construction management software used by our constructor partners (e.g. Procore) creates a transmittal when we return the RFI or submittal. The e-mail we receive when we return RFIs/submittals serves as the transmittal for our records. For this reason, it is critically important that these e-mails be filed in the project shared folder. How should we track RFIs/Submittals if the Contractor/CM is not providing a software solution for this on my project? First, we should push back on the CM/GC for not providing a modern tool. Plangrid is our current recommendation for a low cost software solution the CM/GC can purchase for the project team. We also have existing collaborative tools that can be used for RFI and submittal tracking, Microsoft Excel 365 spreadsheets being the most straightforward. If you are in this situation, please talk to your Technical Director and Design Applications Manager to develop a project-specific plan. The requirement to supply a modern web based tool will be included in  Division One of our specifications. Submittals The process of double-logging submittals is coming to an end!

The requirement to supply a modern web based tool will be included in  Division One of our specifications. Project Email Microsoft Outlook will be the primary tool for filing and searching project email. To be successful, it is critical to file project email . For now, the simplest way is to create individual Project Correspondence Folders for each of your projects and file your e-mails there. This process requires no syncing and will even capture “threaded conversations”, saving a ton of time.  You can create additional subfolders for specific project issues, phases, etc. Outlooks rule-based automation can be utilized to aid in filing not only received but also sent messages. A new Hub app named Outlook Connect is under development and will connect your Project Correspondence Folders with your teams Folders . Frequently Asked Questions Since Outlook Connect isn‘t available yet, how can I gather all the team members’ filed e-mails in one place? If you’re working on a team that fully utilized Newforma’s e-mail filing capabilities, you can replicate that today by taking 2 simple steps: Create this subfolder in the project’s P:/ Drive folder: DOCS/10.0-sharedprojectdata/10.01-email. Have each team member drag and drop all emails from the Project Correspondence Folder into the 10.01-email folder on a pre-arranged schedule. The Project Manager or Project Architect should set the cadence for this activity and inform the team. You can then search the contents of the 10.01-email folder using Microsoft Explorer. How will I file my emails without Newforma? Create individual project folders, much like the Newforma Items to File folders you already have. You can then just drag and drop your e-mails into that folder. This process does not require a sync and will include “threaded messages” saving a lot of time.  For the moment these will remain in your Outlook, but once the Outlook Connect app becomes available, it will consolidate e-mail correspondence from all team members’ Project Correspondence Folders.   The typical way anyone shares emails with team members in any industry is simply to forward them to the appropriate people on the team.   It might be beneficial to include a communication plan in your Digital Execution Plan on who to copy on project communication so everyone always has the necessary information.   Another option is to move project conversations to MS Teams channels where all members have access no matter who communication was flowing to or from, even when they join the project team later on. As a Project Manager, how can I find team e-mail communication that I have not been included in? If the e-mail originated with an employee who is no longer with Perkins&Will, please discuss options with your local Operations Director and HR representative. For e-mails that originated with current employees, please tell them directly about transferring the e-mails to the shared project folder. How will we find project information once it has been closed out, if an issue arises or we go to litigation? How searchable is the e-mail, do we have an alternate indexing method of finding e-mails? E-mails that are not filed are saved in a firmwide repository that includes ALL EMAIL including those deleted or misfiled. Access to these e-mails is controlled and you will need to discuss with your local Operations Director, HR Manager, and Technical Director, and our Legal team. IT/HR/Legal will work together with the project team leadership to access what is needed during any type of legal scenario. How can we access emails from employees that no longer work for Perkins&Will? If e-mails are filed in the shared project folder, they will continue to be available there. We strongly encourage everyone to file all project-related e-mails in these folders. All e-mails sent from Perkins&Will addresses are saved by the firm, but access to these must be coordinated with your local Human Resources Manager and Operations Director. Please do not store project information in locations that are tied only to your accounts like OneDrive or your inbox. Doing so will make life difficult for your project team when you move off a project or decide to leave Perkins&Will. What is going to happen with the emails currently archived in Newforma, how will I find them? All emails that were filed in Newforma are stored in the related P drive project folders under DOCS\\10.0-sharedprojectdata\\10.01-email as msg files.   You can search using windows explorer.   After you search a folder in the advanced options of the search tab in windows explorer there is an option to index the file contents of a non-indexed location so that your search results will include text inside the emails. Field Observation The cloud-based process we’ve adopted with BIM360 will now allow us to streamline the process of doing Field Observations and creating our Field Observation Reports. Using the software tools we already have and some simple hardware setups, you and your team will be able to take site observation images, pin them to the project plans, identify issues, and then create a Field Observation Report immediately. The days of taking a whole day to download your site photos and write up the report are over! Reach out to Digital Practice or your Technical Director for a demonstration on how mobile devices can speed up your site walk workflows.

January 27, 2026 / by Daniel.Prager@perkinswill.com FacadesPlus Los Angeles 2025 Tina Giorgadze and Luc Deckinga were onstage at the last FacadesPlus conference of 2025 in Los Angeles on December 12th. They presented ‘From Artwork to Architecture: Translating Community Identity into Facade Design’ which shared the inspiration behind and design process used to create a tiled mosaic artwork for the Kaiser Permanente Watts Medical Building & Watts Counseling and Learning Center. Their presentation was followed by a hands-on workshop that walked the participants through the Rhino and Grasshopper files used to create the mosaic tile patterns. January 6, 2026 / by Luc.Deckinga@perkinswill.com Chicago Innovate Hackathon December 2, 2025 / by Mario.Romero@perkinswill.com Speckle-Con 2025 SpeckleCon 2024 brought together AEC technology leaders from around the world to share invaluable advancements and knowledge aimed at accelerating the application of technology in the AEC industry. This year, the meetup took place on November 13-14 in London—the global hub for innovation in design, construction, and BIM. December 2, 2025 / by Adam.Burnham@perkinswill.com CDFAM This recent CDFAM symposium held this Fall in New York at Newlab in the Brooklyn Navy Yards had a wide range of speakers from different industries. This year’s keynote speakers Markus J. Buehler from MIT and Ian Pegler from NVIDIA each shared their perspectives on AI and product development respectively. Buehler makes the case that LLM’s will give us “brilliant parrots”, but they will not give us discovery. Behler defines discovery as the art of “asking the right question to express ideas. LLM’s cannot express ideas”. AI models cannot be trained on data and expect it to discover something outside of that data. Discovery requires outside perspectives. AI can help convert complexities into principles and create graphs which humans can use to help discover relationships. Pegler claims that a lot of innovation happens at one’s desk à people at work, by themselves in momentary isolation, able to think and question, something that AI cannot do.

Each of which a certain person will be responsible for in order to ensure a successful gallery. Below is a list of the tools used and which group may be responsible for each aspect. Rhino Design Team/Digital Practice Enscape Design Team/Digital Practice Pano2VR Digital Practice/Vizlab The Anatomy of the Gallery Gallery Layout Gallery Camera Locations Bay Layouts Previous Previous Previous Next Next Next The gallery space is broken up into 9 separate Bays Each Bay contains 8 boards (A-H) Each Bay also contains 4 camera locations These camera locations are used to render out the 37 panoramas that make up the virtual gallery This diagram shows all of the camera locations Interior Elevation Plan Axon Axon 2 The 4 Camera locations are located directly in between each board pair. Each Board is set to a 16:9 aspect ratio to make translating your current slide decks as easy as possible. Getting Started It’s recommended that you place the folder either in your project directory or within a sharepoint directory that all team members can access. To the right is a diagram of the Virtual Gallery folder structure The download for the Virtual Gallery files is located below Download Virtual Gallery Folder Making the Boards Boards in Rhino Boards as Materials Board Naming Convention Board Templates Board PNG Location Previous Previous Previous Next Next Next Each board is a simple rhino surface with a corresponding material Each material is mapped to a corresponding PNG file Rhino supports transparency with png image maps so you can get a little creative with the boards Each PNG file follows the same naming convention: “ B xx BOARD y .png” Where xx is the Bay number, and y is the board location There are two templates that can be used to generate the boards: An InDesign and a Powerpoint Template file Each Bay points to a corresponding Bay folder for its Board material maps Each PNG is named logically So just export your boards into these folders, replacing the PNGs Rendering the Panos Enscape Template Load Settings Load HDRI Rendering Previous Previous Previous Next Next Next We’ve gone ahead and created an Enscape view setting that works for 90% of use cases It uses an HDRI for lighting HOWEVER, feel free to render this space out however you want. In Enscape 3.0 click this button and browse to the Template folder Then select the Dramatic Lighting.json file Finally, back in Enscape, you should be able to click on the imported preset Open the Visual Settings dialog box and click on the Sky tab Then click on the folder in the Load Skybox from File section Then browse to the HDRI in the Template folder Then just render out your panoramas, replacing the ones in the template folder Each pano file follows the same naming convention: “ B xx y .jpg” Where xx is the Bay number, and y is the camera location (e.g. B01A.jpg ) Finalizing the Gallery From here, the team will simply need to coordinate with Digital Practice or Vizlab to get the panoramas uploading to the web. Coordinate Content with either Digital Practice or Vizlab. This could be adding videos, QR codes or links to the final space. Figure out the Address What do you want the address of your Virtual Gallery to be? Final Quality Check Digital Practice or Vizlab will give you a URL while the Gallery is in-progress so you can make sure the gallery is exactly as you want it.",

Multiple workflows and datasets from Business Analyst are useful for NN projects when traditional sources are not available or accurate. Use Cases Job counts by Census block group. When employment data (LEHD) is not available for your study area or existing data is not accurate/recent, use Business Analyst. Example includes: any project in Mississippi because the state does not participate in LEHD program. Employee counts per business/building. Business Analyst can provide a count of employees per business if you need extremely detailed information. This is useful when block groups or other geographies are too large for your study area, and you need to do a more nuanced analysis. Points of interest by type. With Business Analyst you can search for specific types of business (such as grocery stores or pharmacies) if other sources are not helpful. Do note that these would only include business POIs, not recreational POIs or other places without any commerce. Additional data sets (by geography – ex: block groups) that may be useful for projects include: Jobs counts by sector (NAICS code) Daytime population counts (employees + visitors) Projected population growth (2030) Esri Consumer Spending index (modeled spending patterns – ex: public transit, bike share, parking) Esri Market Potential index (modeled likelihood to use a product – ex: Lyft/Uber) Access Anyone with an ArcGIS Online account can access Business Analyst. Please note that usage of this tool can consume ArcGIS Online credits. Credits cost the firm money, so be aware of your potential credit usage. Esri credit guidance (and detailed in guides below per analysis) Guides Download data by polygons Job counts by block groups, daytime population, Esri indices Download data by point Employee counts by business, points of interest",

Features include: Route planning: Draw or modify transit routes and stops quickly on a map. Scheduling and rostering: Generate and modify network schedules, assign drivers and vehicles. On-demand service planning: Draw and modify zones, estimate costs, and analyze demand. Travel time analysis (“Jane”): Use isochrones to show how far someone could travel by transit and analyze access to opportunities. Data and demographic layers: Overlay demographics, destinations, or other datasets to understand impacts of network changes in study area. Remix offers built in calculations and statistics to see real time estimates including demographic and cost changes. Multiple output options: Generate standard exports to use in other software like GIS (shapefiles, GTFS, KML, excel), as well as maps for use in reports and presentations. License Access For more information see CeNNtral Station . You can access Remix via NN’s licenses or via a client agency’s license. If your client has licenses, that’s preferable as NN only has a limited number of seats. When licensed via a client agency, you should only actively work on project for licensed client agencies. NN has 25 licenses for Remix Transit. Contact James Zhang (NY) to request a license. Resources Headways and Speed Extract Tool Use an excel template to calculate headways and speeds per hour automatically from Remix outputs. Instructions and template can be found in this folder . Contact James Zhang (NY) for more info.",

ComfyUI and Forge WebUI are user interfaces designed to make working with Stable Diffusion more accessible. ComfyUI provides a node-based visual interface, allowing users to interact with and manipulate the model’s workflow easily, making it more customizable and intuitive for those without coding experience. Forge WebUI , on the other hand, offers a text-based interface that simplifies the process of running and interacting with Stable Diffusion in a browser, providing more user-friendly features and tools to enhance image generation and editing. Both UI tools help streamline the process of utilizing Stable Diffusion’s capabilities, making it more approachable for a wider audience.

    "content": "Presenters: Harish Palani Objectives: Have you ever poured your heart into a design, only to discover later it’s impractical to build? Architects are constantly challenged by the manufacturability of products during design. The ability to assess this early is a critical need for architecture teams. To maintain details, design teams often resort to copying elements from past projects leading to outdated solutions. By the time designers and manufacturers connect, the design is largely set, leaving limited options. What if you could design with the certainty that your vision can become a reality, seamlessly integrating into the world of industrialized construction? Autodesk Informed Design for Revit software is a solution that brings manufacturing information to the beginning of the design process. In this session, we’ll learn how architects can use informed design to collaborate with subcontractors to share manufacturing model data. We’ll discuss how this workflow can improve project certainty and prevent reworks . Collateral: View Slide Deck View Presentation Video Presented: October 2024",

This script employs a form-finding method that relies upon Kangaroo, a Grasshopper plugin that enables you to apply real-world physics forces to your Rhino geometry. Kangaroo can convert a surface into a grid of points, connected to one another by springs. This effectively turns the surface into a piece of fabric that can be draped, pinned, stretched, and deformed based on the forces that you apply to it. In the example, the perimeter points have been ‘anchored’ in place so they do not move. All points are connected to one another with lines that try to maintain the same length. This turns the surface into a spring network. Finally, a uniform ‘up’ force is applied to all the points, stretching the springs, eventually arriving at a catenary surface that is fit to the courtyard.

The package gets updated every six months (in April and November). Relocating Local R Package Folder These steps redefine the R user packages folder in R to use a “Local” folder within your R user profile, which for me is: C:/Users/EshelO/Local/R/win-library/3.4 . The username will need to be modified The R version will need to be modified Any user-writable folder will work; IT has agreed on this as a standard location. The same folder can be used for the ArcGIS default geodatabase, Github repository directory, etc.). Relocate your existing R user library folder (which for me was in C:/Users/EshelO/Document/R/win-library/3.4 (if Documents has already been migrated, this would be C:/Users/EshelO/OneDrive - Perkins and Will/Documents) to C:/Users/EshelO/Local/R/win-library (or per above) Test the change: Run .libPaths(\"C:/Users/EshelO/Local/R/win-library/3.4\") (modifying as necessary) – this is only for your current R session Run .libPaths() and you should be able to validate this worked Run a test require() and install.packages() to verify R can both read and install to the new location require ( dplyr ) install.packages ( \"tidycensus\" ) Installing and Configuring Git & GitHub Git is a version control system, a tool that tracks changes to your code and shares those changes with others. Git is most useful when combined with GitHub , a website that allows you to share your code with the world, solicit improvements via pull requests and track issues. Git + GitHub is the most popular version control system for developers of R packages (thousands of R packages are hosted on GitHub) and many other types of software. Git and GitHub are generally useful for all software development and data analysis, not just R packages. To use Git/GitHub with R, you will need to set up a GitHub account and configure RStudio to interface with GitHub. Detailed instructions for this can be found here . File a help ticket with IT to have Git installed. To get an Enterprise P+W account: – Create your own personal github account; recommend setting up using your personal e-mail – Email Joel Register your github username and ask to be added to the Nelsonteam – “Could I request to join the enterprise GitHub account? My username is XXXXX.” Installing RTools RTools is a collection of development tools that are essential for writing and releasing packages. The latest RTools package can be downloaded from the CRAN website . File a help ticket to have it installed. If everything goes well, you will have a new directory on your computer called C:/Rtools.

You will only have to do this once, as the environment variable should be remembered on your user account even if you are using a different node computer. Step 1: Open the Environment Variables Settings for your User Account The easiest way to access the environment variables settings is to open up Control Panel (within your Start menu), and then search for the settings using the keyword ‘environment’. You will want to click on ‘edit the environment variables’ link to open the dialog, as shown in the screenshot below. Step 2: Create a New Environment Variable Click the ‘New’ button to create a new environment variable. Type in R_LIBS_USER for the variable name and G:/Resources/r_package_library for the variable value. Press OK. Step 3: Confirm Your New Variable has been Saved Confirm your new variable is reflected in the list of user environment variables as below. Press OK to confirm. Step 4: Verify Settings in RStudio You can verify that this environment variable is set to the correct value you set above anytime by running the following line of code: Sys.getenv ( x = 'R_LIBS_USER' ) It should return the path you just set above ( 'G:/Resources/r_package_library' ) . If it does not for some reason, please contact Team Data or #team-data. Related Resources Using R locally Setting up a project folder",

    "content": "Walkshed Diagrams: Phase/Frameworks: Pre-Design / Schematic Description This workflow helps teams quickly produce walkshed/drive-time diagrams to aid in site analysis in early design. “Neighborhoods should be compact, pedestrian-friendly, and mixed-use,” and “many activities of daily living should be within walking distance,” according to the Charter of the New Urbanism . These diagrams provide a visual representation of the accessible walking distance from a specific point or area, taking into account various factors such as pedestrian infrastructure, land use patterns, and urban form. By analyzing and mapping the walkshed, designers can understand the extent to which key destinations and amenities, such as schools, parks, public transportation, and commercial areas, are within a comfortable walking distance for potential users. This information helps inform the placement and layout of buildings, streets, and open spaces, ensuring that the design promotes walkability, encourages active transportation, and fosters vibrant, livable communities. Walkshed diagrams also enable designers to identify gaps or barriers in the pedestrian network, guiding decisions for improving connectivity and enhancing the overall pedestrian experience in the urban environment. Workflow Description: We are using ArcGIS Online to do this. Contact Elton Gjata for access if needed. Step 1) Find the Start Location on a map. a) Sign in to ArcGIS Online. https://nelsonnygaard.maps.arcgis.com/ b) Click on Map at the top. c) Search for a location using the magnifying loop icon. Step 2) Set this location as the center of the study. a) Add this location as a pin on a new sketch layer. A new layer will be added to the map document, on the left hand side of the screen. b) Rename your layer to something logical. We suggest the address of the location. Step 3) Create Walk-Time Areas a) Click on Analysis on the right hand edge of the screen. Under the Tools hammer, look for Generate Travel Areas . b) Configure the type of study. Options include: Walking Time, Walking Distance, Driving Time, Driving Distance. The cutoff distances and cutoff units are important. This controls the radii that we want to use for the study. c) Export the results layer. The walkshed layer will be added to the current map. Step 3) Edit the layer style. Edit the properties of a layer to change the color ramp for the walkshed a) Click the dots on the layer, and click on Show Properties. b) Click on Edit Layer Style. c) Edit the style options to your liking.

By Adding input parameters, such as site, building geometry, and sound source characteristics, the script generates a visual representation of sound attenuation at grade and building open areas. The output can be used to gain quick preliminary insights into the site and to inform design decisions related to acoustic comfort. Workflow Description: The script follows the law of sound attenuation below: The sound source is highlighted with its simulated range. The sound source is subsequently projected on both the ground plane and building facades. And finally, the projected sound levels are overlaid on the surface to estimate impact.

    "content": "Outdoor Comfort – Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI): Phase/Frameworks: Ideation/Development Description This script aids in decision-making for redevelopment projects to offer new & better alternatives based on the thermal quality of public places and lowering energy usage by establishing and choosing better microclimate locations. UTCI is a thermal comfort model strictly for the outdoors. It is an international standard for outdoor temperature sensation (aka. “feels-like” temperature) and is one of the most common of such “feels-like” temperatures used by meteorologists. UTCI that attempts to satisfy the following requirements: Thermo-physiological significance in the whole range of heat exchange conditions. Valid in all climates, seasons, and scales. Useful for key applications in human biometeorology. Assumptions While UTCI is designed to be valid in all climates and seasons, it assumes that human subjects are walking (with a metabolic rate around 2.4 met) and that they naturally adapt their clothing with the outdoor temperature. For outdoor situations that do not fit these criteria, the Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) model is recommended. Workflow Description: Below is an example of the script library analysis process: Inputs air_temp [Required] Data Collection or individual value for air temperature in C. mrt Data Collection or individual value for mean radiant temperature (MRT) in C. Default is the same as the air_temp. rel_humid [Required] Data Collection or individual value for relative humidity in %. Note that percent values are between 0 and 100. wind_vel Data Collection or individual value for meteoroligical wind velocity at 10 m above ground level in m/s. Note that this meteorological velocity at 10 m is simply 1.5 times the speed felt at ground level in the original Fiala model used to create the UTCI model. Therefore, multiplying air speed values at the height of the human subject by 1.5 will make them a suitable input for this component. Default is a low speed of 0.5 m/s, which is the lowest input speed that is recommended for the UTCI model. utci_par Optional comfort parameters from the “LB UTCI Comfort Parameters” component to specify the temperatures (in Celcius) that are considered acceptable/comfortable. The default will assume a that the comfort range is between 9C and 26C. run [Required] Set to True to run the component. Outputs report Reports, errors, warnings, etc. et to True. utci Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) in Celcius. comfort Integers noting whether the input conditions result in no thermal stress. Values are one of the following: * 0 = thermal stress * 1 = no thremal stress condition Integers noting the thermal status of a subject. Values are one of the following: * -1 = cold * 0 = netural * +1 = hot category Integers noting the category that the UTCI conditions fall under on an 11-point scale. Values are one of the following: * -5 = Extreme Cold Stress (UTCI < -40) * -4 = Very Strong Cold Stress (-40 <= UTCI < -27) * -3 = Strong Cold Stress (-27 <= UTCI < -13) * -2 = Moderate Cold Stress (-12 <= UTCI < 0) * -1 = Slight Cold Stress (0 <= UTCI < 9) * 0 = No Thermal Stress (9 <= UTCI < 26) * +1 = Slight Heat Stress (26 <= UTCI < 28) * +2 = Moderate Heat Stress (28 <= UTCI < 32) * +3 = Strong Heat Stress (32 <= UTCI < 38) * +4 = Very Strong Heat Stress (38 <= UTCI < 46) * +5 = Extreme Heat Stress (46 < UTCI) comf_obj A Python object containing all inputs and results of the analysis. This can be plugged into components like the “Comfort Statistics” component to get further information.

Grasshopper brings a collection of new components for interacting with Revit, as well as providing access to the two software APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) using its script components. Rhino.Inside.Revit provides a set of tools for bridging the gap between Rhino’s free-form modelling and the world of BIM, opening Grasshopper’s rich ecosystem to the Revit environment, and enabling completely new design workflows and possibilities.

Open CTG Skill Matrix Here are some key highlights: GIS – Several strong GIS users! However, please note a few items: Due to ongoing IT transitions and updating our own NN GIS workflows and templates the past few weeks, we still have to give the full Team Data orientation to most CTG staff. This includes explaining our folder structure, software access, templates, styles, tools, etc.). There will be a transition period of them getting up to speed with everything like any other new hire. Until then, they cannot immediately jump into NN projects fully without support from other staff and more experienced NN GIS users. NN primarily uses ArcMap for GIS. Many CTG staff are more comfortable with ArcPro (the newer version of GIS software). Please be aware of this as CTG staff may need additional time and/or support to re-acclimate to doing things in ArcMap. There will also need to be coordination with NN GIS users for any work CTG staff would like to do in ArcPro ArcGIS Online – Some have experience in ArcGIS Online such as developing Storymap. CTG has their own ArcGIS Online account. We are planning to merge CTG and NN’s ArcGIS Online account in March Tableau – several Tableau users! R – we already started working with R users! Please also see the “notes” column . Some expressed interest in specific types of projects",

Somos marcadas por uma educação que, por muito tempo, trabalhou sistematicamente para contribuir com o apagamento das mulheres na arquitetura. Essa conversa propõe trazer à luz o reconhecimento e apresentação de arquitetas pioneiras, bem como identificar o papel de grandes arquitetas nos debates contemporâneos de mais alto nível. Mariana Alves Barbosa Mariana é arquiteta, pesquisadora e consultora especialista em proteção contra incêndio, formada pela FAU Mackenzie (2017) e pós-graduada pela Associação Escola da Cidade (2021). É idealizadora e co-fundadora do Arqtetatlas, coletivo de curadoria e pesquisa ativista de projetos contemporâneos concebidos por arquitetas latino-americanas. Atualmente é mestranda do Programa de Pós-Graduação em Arquitetura e Urbanismo da Universidade P. Mackenzie, onde desenvolve sua pesquisa sobre mulheres na arquitetura.",

Scores are calculated for each street segment based on roadway infrastructure, such as number of lanes and posted speed. Narrower roads with low posted speeds receive higher points, as they are often easier for pedestrians to cross. By contrast, wider roads with high posted speeds receive fewer points, as they are generally more difficult to cross. The proximity to a signalized crossing is also considered, and street segments within a certain distance from a signalized intersection receives additional points.

Quality can vary a lot. For labor purposes, spray applicators and plasterers are in the same union and can take on both scopes. However, keep in mind that specifying spray applied only application and asking the spray applier to knockdown will not have the same quality results as having a plasterer do the work. What is shown in these images is a trowel grade (TG) cementitious product that is spray applied and then troweled smooth(ish). Maybe a multi-person operation and requiring skilled labor. Upon further review, the spec just needed to specify the right product that matched the application method.",

This week on Coffee Lab, we’ll be joined by Liisa Pangborn and Daniel Lee Tucker from the Seattle studio (DTL + DA Power Combo!) As seen from its chilling introduction in the recent Netflix hit ‘Squid Game’, the cool whipped coffee’s “Dalgona” namesake does originate from the traditional Korean toffee candy; but the actual drink recipe’s historic origins come from all over the world. Known as phenti-hui in Pakistan, and long practiced as a frothier frappé in Greece, the ice drink we all enjoy as whipped coffee is truly a global collaboration project that has come together, refined  by everyone contributing. For this week’s episode, Liisa will be demonstrating her super barista skills making the global phenomenon drink while Daniel will be showing off best practice tips/tricks from Miro for collaborating and presenting, hope to see you all there!

Key Features: Highly customizable. Can be embedded in a website; or sent as file attachment to open in browser as quick share method The scripts for both analysis and map production are stored in R and can be easily shareable as part of project deliverable Consideration Requires R knowledge if a client wants to maintain the dashboard Cost None.

Example Portland Pedestrian Master Plan Collision Dashboard (2017.0108) – see example below Using ArcGIS Online Esri’s ArcGIS online has Dashboard tool with interactive map, filter functions, charts and tables. The biggest advantage  of using ArcGIS online is that it is easy to develop – no programing language required. This tool requires ArcGIS online account. Contact Team Data for account information. Key Features Easy to develop, no programing language required Can develop a “website” (multiple pages with tabs) with dashboard by using Experience Builder. Can add a page for data source or guides. Reads GIS layers and symbology set up in GIS Can incorporate GIS layers already hosted in ArcGIS online (for example, city boundary layer hosted on the client’s data portal) Easy to transfer data to client’s ArcGIS online account when the project is done (or develop using their ArcGIS online account) Consideration No password protection option Limited design customization. It uses Esri’s template as a base Ideal to host the dashboard on the client’s ArcGIS online because collision dataset is typically large (which consumes a lot of Esri credits) Cost Cost “credits” to store data in ArcGIS online Example Vancouver TSP Update Collision Dashboard (2019.0208) – see example below Sample Projects PDOT Collision Dashboard (2017.0108) Vancouver TSP Internal Tool (2019.0208) Vancouver TSP Public Dashboard (2019.0208)",

Bus delay is typically quantified based on aggregated AVL data and is calculated as the difference between the 80th percentile travel time and the 20th percentile travel time. The BDAT tool is used for transit agency’s project prioritization process for the bus service network. Level of Effort High This more complex iteration of BDAT was developed in a combined project between the two agencies and is expected to cost between $100-150k when complete. Using the codebase for another project, some cost could be saved, but there are custom elements/costs for each agency that must be developed from scratch.

What is Replica? Multiple datasets are available through Replica and can be found in the left-hand tab menu on the home page after logging in. — Places (Studies) — Replica Places (also called Studies) are high-fidelity activity-based travel models that simulate the movements of residents, visitors, and commercial vehicles in a given area. Replica produces Places models as “megaregions,” each covering about 30 million people, for a typical weekday and typical weekend day in a given season. Data outputs can be queried down to the network link level. ( Replica 2022 ) At NN, we most often use Places data to map travel flows over a study area, with the additional ability to break down flows by demographic group and other trip characteristics (for example: time of day, mode, etc.). — Trends (Dashboards) — Replica Trends (also called Dashboards) is a nationwide activity-based model updated each week with near-real-time data on mobility, consumer spending, and Covid-19 cases. Trends has census-tract-level fidelity with mobility data including origins and destinations, trip mode, and trip purpose, and consumer spending data in aggregate and across a number of sub-categories, including retail, grocery stores, restaurants, and travel. Replica generates its data by running large-scale, computationally intensive simulations. These simulations allow us to deliver granular data outputs that match behavior in aggregate, but don’t surface the actual movements (or compromise the privacy) of any one individual. ( Replica 2022 ) Trends is useful for quickly viewing travel patterns, up to the latest week, for a study area. You can create a custom dashboard to track data over time. — Traffic Data — Found via the ‘Data Downloads’ menu from the home screen, in the Traffic section, this data includes: Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) – Daily traffic per network link by season. Turning Movement Counts – Motor vehicle trip counts at most signalized intersection for each day of the week, bucketed into 1-hour intervals. Free-Flow Speeds – Annual average free-flow speed per network link. Quarter Hourly Speeds Profile – Average observed speed per network link, provided in quarter-hourly buckets for a typical week. — Reference Downloads — Found via the ‘Reference Downloads’ menu from the home screen, this data includes: Geographic Data – Files that include the geographic boundaries, street network, and transit services used in other Replica products (such as Places and Trends). Any tabular data in Replica can joined to geographic data in GIS for spatial analysis and mapping purposes. Land Use – Current use of land and buildings for the area included in your geography. This data can be used if no other land use data is available for your study area. Replica land use data in more generalized and not officially produced by a local jurisdiction. Parking Spaces – One-street and lot (off-street) parking data includes the number of spaces, rate structures, opening hours, operators, and other attributes. Note, this dataset is not comprehensive over a study area. On-street parking spaces are often available in limited areas of a city, typically where there’s the highest competition for an on-street spot. Off-street parking is also limited to commercial lots and public facilities. For example, restricted commercial spots (parking allowed only for customers of a store) will generally not be included. See coverage map for more detail. — Report Data — Transit Data Report – Replica provides transit summary reports such as transit mobility patterns or transit rider summary at a high-level. You should use BigQuery transit dataset for detailed information. Click link to access this data. Transit Routes (Stops Level Data and Counts Report) – This report displays detailed information about modeled transit ridership. Click link to access this data. — Big Query — Replica offers direct access to Places data outputs through Google BigQuery. This dataset is the same format as Places, but includes transit route info with trip start/end point (lat/lon) info instead of generalized to block groups. In other words, each trip activity is associated with transit route information if trip takers are using public transit as their primary mode for their trips. It allows you to analyze origin-destination trip patterns of a specific transit agency’s riders.

The data is updated annually and available at census block level, but can be easily aggregated. Income is defined by state unemployment insurance law, but it is generally pre-tax. IMPORTANT! Data collected at Headquarters: employment data is collected at headquarters, such as the administrative building for all the schools in the area. Make sure to review the result carefully to make sure the result “makes sense”. Example : In the map below, the largest blue dot on the left represents the tax address of 65% of the jobs in Los Alamos County, but in reality they are spread out across the county. LEHD Data Download Tool The LEHD download tool was developed by Paul Leitman using R/Shiny. The tool allows users to download data for the number of jobs or for employee travel flows between home and work geographies. It relies on data from the US Census Bureau’s LODES datasets. To improve Nelson\\Nygaard’s analysis capabilities and reduce the staff hours to extract LEHD data, the tool exports data as CSV, Excel and as shapefiles. Additionally, the tool allows data to be summarized into 14 different geography types, as well as custom geographies or into a grid of squares or hexagons (which are generated directly in the tool).

It refers to the consideration, through an equity lens, of the ways in which data is collected, analyzed, interpreted, and distributed. It underscores marginalized communities’ unequal opportunities to access data and, at times, their harm from data’s misuse. It raises the issue of data sovereignty and the democratization of data. And data equity pushes us to consider the ways that data can reinforce stereotypes, exacerbate problems like racial bias, or otherwise undermine social justice.

Currently, only 5-year estimates are available through the tool. Data is available at the country, tract, and block group level for 2010 – 2021 (as tables are available for particular years). More features and variables will continue to be added to the tool, please request features by taking this short survey . You can download the data with or without geometries (i.e. shapefiles), and you must join the data yourself after making any edits (if necessary) to the tabular data. Comparing ACS data over time You may need to compare multiple ACS datasets to examine trends over time. Keep in mind the following when comparing ACS data: Make sure the data periods do not overlap . For examples, it is OK to compare 2005-2009 ACS 5-year estimates to 2010-2014 ACS 5-year estimates Some ACS variables change over time . When comparing multiple datasets, use the Census web page below to make sure a specific subject/topic is comparable over time.

StoryMaps often contains text, web maps, static images and infographics. A simple survey can be also added into StoryMaps. StoryMaps has two sharing options: Public (anyone can access to it). Restricted ArcGIS online group:  Requires ArcGIS online account. There is no option to add a password protection. What influence the budget? Questions to ask. How many  webmaps do we need to produce? Are the maps complicated? How many layers do we need to  include in the map(s)? Do we need to produce custom graphics (for example,  infographics by VizComm) Do you want to add a survey to the storymap? Simple StoryMap 10 hours : 5 hours for storymap itself, 5 hours for setting up webmaps. Note that this does not include hours for GIS analysis or custom graphic production (i.e. infographic produced by VizComm). Examples (See Map Collection below) Go Norman Transit Study (2020.0529) Complex StoryMap 20+ hours: Make sure to budget enough hours for additional components such as survey or custom graphics.

StreetLight is a dataset that provides insight into how, where, and when people travel. The dataset itself is based on anonymous data collected from mobile devices (e.g., cell phones, tablets), which is then cleaned and processed. This data processing considers under sampling that may occur for a given area, based on known Census population data and traffic counters installed by municipalities. Data is typically defined based on zones, which can be either user-defined (with a shapefile) or picked from standard geographies (e.g., census geographies like tracts, block groups) that Streetlight has saved for a given region.

Bainbridge Island has ambitious climate goals—including a 90% GHG reduction target—and the Sustainable Transportation Plan is key piece of their strategy to meet those goals. To support the identification of infrastructure, program, and policy gaps, the team created an interactive map that brings together dozens of data layers (including existing data, NN analyses, and community input). By turning on and off different combinations of layers that connect to plan goals, our Sustainable Transportation Task Force and City Council have been able to see behind the analysis curtain and participate in the process we’ve used to identify needs. (Radical transparency is the name of the planning game on the Island.)

The primary goal of the analysis was to develop a crash typology for pedestrian, bicycle, and severe/fatal vehicle crashes that would assist the City of Portland in countermeasure identification. We also developed an interactive crash dashboard to help them visualize these data, especially in relation to the High Crash Network identified for Vision Zero. Project Information Project name : Portland Pedestrian Master Plan Project code : 2017.0108 Sector : Transit Hub page : Link Level of Effort High (16+ hrs) Assuming the crash data are in relatively clean shape, the basic elements of the crash dashboard do not take long to develop (e.g., can go from raw data to dashboard in 30-40 hours). The most time consuming aspect of a crash analysis is the typing process, because it is necessarily subjective and based upon local knowledge and a variety of factors that exist outside of the crash data and may be in various states of data cleanliness. For example, for Portland, the crash data were clean, but their number of lanes dataset for their streets was not, and we spent another 20-30 hours just cleaning up this single dataset. So adding more supplemental datasets that are not already well prepared will add time to the analysis.

Using a similar methodology to TriMet, a segment network was developed to represent all bus service in the region, allowing for geographic aggregation of transit performance data across multiple routes and agencies. Bus delay was quantified based on aggregated AVL data over the Fall 2019 and 2020 service periods, and is weighted and/or normalized in a variety of metrics by passenger loading and service level. This dashboard is facilitating ongoing project prioritization for the bus service network in the Seattle region.

As part of ongoing work for TriMet’s Enhanced Transit Corridor Program , Nelson\\Nygaard developed a segment network to represent TriMet bus service. This segment network was used as the basis for a Dashboard that enables interactive examination of bus delay. Bus delay was quantified based on aggregated AVL data over the Fall 2018 and Fall 2019 service periods, and is calculated as the difference between the 80th percentile travel time and the 20th percentile travel time.

Given a set of data points (a set of inputs and outputs), we can quickly use mathematical models and statistical analysis using R to generate this surface plot so you can start to understand how changes in two inputs and one output effect the other averaged over all the other inputs and outputs not shown in the chart. This is one the powerful benefits of running a large number of simulations in your parametric study. ‌ 1. Select Two Design Parameters 2. and One Performance Choose two design parameters ( 1 ) and one building performance ( 2 ) to see the 3D parametric influence surface ( 3 ).‌ You should first click on the display boxes next to two design parameters you wish to evaluate and identify what axis to shown the parameters on, from x, y, and z axes. Then select one building performance by clicking on the display box next to it and identify the axes.",

Similar to the 2D scatter plot, 3D plot uses both sphere and footprint icons to display multi-dimensional data. The features are similar to 2D scatter plots. You can choose the points (spheres) to be shown as the building geometry: Do it by switching the “Sphere” toggle to “Building” You can activate the “EUI Target/Benchmark” button and compare the results with the energy use intensity target and benchmark, which are represented as lines or surfaces By hovering over each point in scatter plot, you are able to see the corresponding design model with the main building information listed along with the plot.",

The data results are displayed as a collection of design points, each having the value of one building performance determining the position on the horizontal axis and the value of the other building performance determining the position on the vertical axis. ‌ 1. Select Performance Parameters Select two items from the list of building performances to be shown in x an z axes. ‌ 2. 2D Scatter Plot By hovering over each point in scatter plot, you are able to see the corresponding design model with the main building information listed along the plot. ‌ 3. Limit Design/Performance Parameters You can limit the values of “Design” or “Performance” in the exploration, by putting constraints on these parameters on the right side of the scatter plot. Those values of parameters outside the constraints are grayed out in the plot. 4. Modifying Scatter Plot Visualization n order to better investigate what point corresponds to what footprint shape, you can choose the points (spheres) to be shown as the building geometry: Do it by switching the “Sphere” toggle to “Building”. You can change the size and view angle of the footprint shapes by clicking on the lock button at the top of the chart. If one of the performance you are evaluating is EUI, you would be able to click on the “EUI Target/Benchmark” toggle and change it to Yes. the EUI Target is shown as a green line and EUI Benchmark as a red line in the EUI axis. One important features you can activate in scatter plot is the Pareto Front line. A design point is defined to be Pareto Front, or Pareto Optimal, if no other design in the set is better in both objective values. In other words, the design points within the Pareto Front line represents the best or the most optimal designs for the two building performances selected in the plot. Change the toggle of pareto front to Yes in order to show it in the plot. If you click on the “Reset Shading” button, you’ll see that the color of each design point, either shown as sphere or building, changes showing the worst to the best design options according to the legend at the right side of the plot. The default assumptions for the color of each design point is that you prefer to minimize both building performances evaluated in the plot, and also both performances have the same importance for you. You can change these assumptions by toggling between Min and Max as your goal for each building performance (for instance, in the example below, we want to maximize Daylight Autonomy, while minimizing EUI). You can also change your preference on the importance of each performance by changing the value of the Output Preference Shading. If it is in the middle, in which both performances are 50, it means that both performances are equally important (in the below plot for instance, we changed preference shading to be 25% for Daylight Autonomy and 75% for EUI, because energy performance were more important for us).",

It shows data in multiple axes aligned in parallel to each other. Each vertical axis represents a different variable that the designer wants to evaluate. A line passes through each design criteria point in the data set. SPEED shows the values of a design point at the intersection of the polyline and vertical axes, and you can “brush” the vertical values to assign constraints to the input or output variable. ‌ 1. Select from the Design Parameters and 2. Performance Parameters Select the display boxes next to each design parameter and building performance to be shown in a parallel coordinate graph. ‌ 3. Interactive PCP Chart SPEED shows the values of a design point at the intersection of the polyline and vertical axes. By hovering the mouse over each polyline, users can find the specification of the design and see the corresponding geometry at the top left of the window. Users can “brush” the vertical values to assign constraints to the input or output variable. ‌ 4.

A parametric study is the exploration of relationships and tradeoffs between different design parameters and the building performance result from the simulation of those design parameters. By using a parametric study, designers can assess the impact that changing certain parameters can have on the design of their energy and daylighting performance goals. The more design options you analyze in a parametric study, the more information you will have available to you to understand the impacts of your design decisions. However, there are certain things you should keep in mind when building your parametric study, as more is not always better. Until you become more familiar with SPEED and how the statistical analysis works, we recommend running parametric studies between 500-2000 design options (or simulations). Less than this, you will lose the power of doing statistical analysis on your runs. More than this, and you start to get into some more challenging decisions to make that require some more training such as whether you should choose fewer design variables with more options each, or more design variables with fewer options each. Energy Lab will assist you in learning how to make these decisions once you feel comfortable with navigating the GUI and interpreting the results visualizations. 1. Model Input This dropdown shows the design inputs that are available for your parametric study. Select model inputs one by one, and “Add” them as Design Variables to run simulations for various values of the input. A Model Input should not be defined as a Design Variable if only one option is to be evaluated. 2. Select Design Options Design Variables : This list shows the parameters you choose for your study from the Model Inputs window. By clicking on a Design Variable after adding it to your study, a list of available Design Options for your analysis will be shown in Design Options Available. ‌ Design Option Available : This is the list of options for each Design Variable. Select the ones you would like to compare, either one or multiple at a time, and click on the forward blue icon to push them into the Design Options Selected window. You may also drag and drop them into the Design Options Selected window. ‌ Design Option Selected : This is the list of your selected Design Options for your parametric study. You may remove selection options by highlighting them and clicking the back button or dragging and dropping it. 3. Parametric Study Profile The Parametric study profiles show the number of runs resulted from the design option you have created, and the time needed to run the study.",

Run Daylighting Simulation Check this box to run a daylighting simulation in addition to an energy simulation for spaces with exterior windows. The daylighting simulation is run first, then the results are used to create modified lighting schedules for the energy simulation.‌ Daylight Simulation Engine : There are two daylight simulation engines available for daylight assessment:‌ EnergyPlus: Selecting EnergyPlus to do the daylighting simulation is much faster than using Radiance. However, it only generates a modified lighting schedule for EnergyPlus, and is less accurate than Radiance. Radiance : By selecting Radiance, you may calculate building-level climate-based, dynamic daylighting metrics such as continuous daylighting autonomy (cDA), useful daylight index (UDI), and daylight saturation (DS), though the calculation of these metrics will take quite a bit longer to run. SPEED also calculates the less useful metric Daylight Factor (DF) for comparison and because it is the metric most familiar to designers.",

The most common selection for designers at the earliest stages of design is “Ideal Air Loads”. This system simply assumes there is enough heating and cooling energy used to meet setpoints, and does not take into account the energy consumption of systems such as chillers, fans, pumps, cooling towers, etc. It often leads to misleading results. SPEEDprovides a list of other 30 high-performance systems to select other than the ideal load system.‌ 1. HVAC Type ‌ Select the Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system you would like to evaluate from the drop-down menu or select the Default. The following HVAC Types are available:‌ “ VAV Reheat “: Variable air volume system with air-side economizer, served by a condensing boiler and air-cooled chiller. “ PVAV Reheat “: Packaged RTU VAV system with air-side economizer, served by a condensing boiler and DX cooling. “ VRF with DOAS “: DOAS system served by DX coils and VRF terminals served by air-cooled VRF outdoor unit. “ VRF with DOAS with DCV “: DOAS system with DCV served by DX Coils and VRF terminals served by air-cooled VRF outdoor unit. “ Ground Source Heat Pumps with DOAS “: DOAS system served by DX coils with zone heat pumps served by a ground-source heat pump loop. “ Ground Source Heat Pumps with DOAS with DCV “: DOAS system with DCV served by DX coils and zone heat pumps served by a ground-source heat pump loop. “ Fan Coils with DOAS “: DOAS system with zone fan coils both served by a condensing boiler and water-cooled chiller with a water-side economizer. “ Fan Coils with DOAS with DCV “: DOAS system with DCV and zone fan coils both served by a condensing boiler and water-cooled chiller with a water-side economizer.",

The default values are defined according to ASHRAE requirements, however, users can uncheck and change the values as required.‌ Space Type : The space type is used to populate certain defaults for parameters of commonly used spaces, such as occupancy, lighting and equipment loads, and schedules. Most of these parameters can be overwritten by the user.‌ (1) Lighting Power Density: LPDis defined as the installed lighting power, in wattages, in a building space divided by the space area in square meters or square feet (watts/ft2 or watts/m2). (2) Equipment Power Density : EPD is the energy used by products that are powered by means of an ordinary AC plug and are measured in watts per square foot or square meter (watts/ft2 or watts/m2). (3) Outside Air : OA is used for ventilation and also to provide free cooling whenever possible. SPEED uses the OA default value based on the ASHRAE requirement for each space type and has another option of having 30% better. (4) Cooling Setpoint : Temperature at which the system will maintain the cooling in all spaces in the zone. SPEED currently has only one default value for the cooling setpoint as 75 F. (5) Heating Setpoint : Temperature at which the system will maintain the heating in all spaces in the zone. SPEED currently has only one default value for the heating setpoint as 70 F. Apply to all Space Types for Parametric Study? If the user wants to define only one Space Loads page input in the parametric study, then they should check the box under the desired input. For example, if you click the box under Lighting Power Density, then in the parametric study only one design variable will show up called “LPD”, and any values assigned to it will be applied to all Space Types. If you keep it unchecked, then in the parametric study you will see “LPD-Space Type X”. “. For the Beta release, we have hard-coded this checkbox to true do minimize the number of simulations run for debugging purposes.",

Building/Facade Mode There are two modes of “Building” and “Floor”:‌ Building : By checking this box, you are allowed to assign only one Space Type to all the zones in the model. This is the only available option when in Analysis Type=1 mode. Floor : By checking this box, you are allowed to assign different Space Types on a given floor plan to different zones. In SPEED, zones are considered the same as spaces. If there are a fixed number of floors, you can assign different Space Types to multiple floor plans. This mode is available when using Analysis Type=2 or Analysis Type=3. ‌ 2. Space Type The Space Type is assigned to various zones in the floor plan to determine default internal loads, outside air requirements, conditioning setpoints, and conditioning schedules. To enable the specification of multi-use buildings, the input Space Type in SPEED is actually a combination of Building Type and conventional Space Type (Building Type-Space Type). For example, for a private office in an office building, the designer would see “Office-Private Office”. For a private office in a retail building, you would see “Retail-Private Office”. The same space type in different building types often has different input assumptions based on energy codes. Therefore, this format allows the user to be able to define the appropriate inputs for multi-use buildings. 3. Area Breakdown A box on the right top of the building geometry views shows the summary of the breakdown of the areas ( 3 ), in which the total area should be equal to 100%. 4. Add Floor Template When using Analysis Type=2 or Analysis Type=3, you are able to assign different space types to multiple floor plans.",

Building/Facade Mode There are two modes available as “Building” and “Façade”.‌ Building : By checking this box, you are able to define envelope inputs that apply to the entire building, independent of façade orientation. Only the “Building” tab will be active. Façade : By checking this box, you are able to define envelope inputs to different façade orientations. The “Building” tab is deactivated, and the tabs for “South”, “West”, “East”, and “North” are active. The default values are the same for all south, west, east, and north facades; however users can make changes by clicking on each orientation tab located at the top of the window. Check the Building tab to apply data to the entire building Check the Facade tab to apply data to each facade separately FACADE MODE | Apply to all Facades : When the user is in the “Facade” mode, they can define all the glazing and shading inputs by facade orientation. However, sometimes the designer may not want to vary an input by orientation, for example for the input Window Type. In this case, if you simply check the box in front of the input here, then that parameter is disabled for the West, East, and North tabs and is assigned the same input value as the South tab.‌ 2. Windows Size/Configuration The glazing for the envelope is defined by the WWR, # of Windows, Window Ratio, and Window Type: By choosing the default option for glazing, the ASHRAE requirements for baseline criteria for the WWR is used given the building type, climate zone, and energy code. The # of windows and window ratios is always set to 4 and 40% respectively as default, but you can change them if you unclick the default option. These latter two inputs determine the design of the window array placed on the facade.‌ WWR : by unchecking the default, you can choose the percentage of windows to wall area as a value between 10 to 90 percent. The default is 40%.‌ # of Windows : you can choose the number of windows as a value between 1 to 10. The default is 4. ‌ Window Layout : this parameter is associated with the spread of the window within the wall. The higher the value, the more horizontally is the window. You can choose the window ratio as a value between 0 and 1. The default is 0.4. Choose the percentage of WWR from the drop-down menu Choose the number of windows from the drop-down menu You can change the window layout ‌ 3. Windows Type/Assembly Assembly Type : The type of assembly can be one of the options of “Metal Framing Curtain Wall, Metal Framing, and Non-Metal Framing.‌ Window Type : by choosing the default option for glazing type, the ASHRAE requirements for baseline building is used given the building type, climate zone, and energy code. By unchecking the default, you can choose from the available library of window types. ‌ 4. Shading Overhang/Fin Depth : The shading for the envelope includes overhangs and fins. If you do not wish to have overhangs or fins, simply keep the value of the length at 0. ‌ 5.  Display Options/ Solar Analysis Note Any info you use inside the Envelope tab will be applied to all footprint shapes.",

It’s designed so the geometry you create must follow the rules of energy models so you always have valid geometry input file for EnergyPlus. ‌ 1. Create New Floor Plan Polygon : Polygon drawing tool 2D/3D : View both 2D and 3D‌ drawings or full canvas in 2D Erase: Boolean eraser to make rectangular cuts out of existing spaces Selection: arrow button to switch into selection mode DXF import: You may export floorplan DXF files from Revit and import them into BST for tracing geometry all at once. the DXF files are all imported into BST, auto-scaled, and placed at the center of the 2d drawing canvas. Select from the dropdown menu here which Level you want to view on that Story. You may drag the DXF file to re-position it by holding down the left-click button and rotate it using the handle at the bottom. Construction Line: The construction lines are snappable, and will serve as your primary guide in creating spaces. Place a construction line by clicking on a starting point with the left click button, and dragging your mouse to create the desired length and angle, and finish the construction line by left-clicking again. As you draw the line, you see the dimensions of your line. 3. Project Navigation Tree To the left of the 2D canvas is the project navigation tree where you can see the hierarchy of the building floors and spaces, the height of each floor, and the area of each space. When you drew a space, the area of the space shows up in the navigation tree with the Space Name. Spaces are color-coded in 2D view, and updates with the same color in 3D view. If no space type is assigned, its color is grey in 2D and 3D views and in the Project Navigation Tree. 4. Add Story/Space You can add a new space, a new story, or a shading element into your project. It is important to remember that when you draw your first space on a story, you DO NOT need to click the Add Space button, you are already in the draw space mode as you can see above in the Project Navigation Tree to the left with space highlighted in bold and underlined. Whenever you draw a space, the area of the space shows up in the Project Navigation Page on the left with the Space Name and the area. Space : Click this every time you want to add a new space to a story. A new space appears in the building tree with 0 area until you draw the space. All your spaces must be drawn adjacent to another one, or within another space. Note that the dotted lines here represent interior walls, and solid lines exterior walls. If you see a solid line that should be a dotted line, that means you drew your geometry with a small gap in between it. Delete one of the spaces and redraw until it’s a dotted boundary. Space Type : At some point, you must assign a space type to every space in your model. This is how we know what defaults for space loads, schedules, etc. to assign to each space. When you click Add Space Type, you will see a drop-down list appear of all the available SPEED Space Types. Select the ones you want to add to your project, and you will see them appear in the white box. This means that this Space Type I loaded into your project and is available to assign to spaces. To do this, first, click on the Space Type name in the box, then go to your 2D canvas and start clicking on spaces. Assign Space Types to all the spaces on your floorplan. Story: You create new stories with the Story button. First, fill in the height of the story, then click the add story button. You will see a new story added to the Building Tree, and you will automatically be in the draw Space mode, so you don’t need to click Add Space for your first space on the story. You can see the story below is made semi-transparent so you have a reference when drawing your spaces on the second story. You may change the story height at any time. Alternatively, when you have floorplans that are quite similar, it’s best to simply duplicate a floor you already spent the time drawing. You can do this with the Duplicate Floor Button by highlighting the Story in the Project Navigation Tree, and click the Duplicate button to copy the floor above it. You can then modify it. Shading : You can create site context or shading buildings using the shading button. First, fill in the height of the shading building you desire, then click the shading button. You will see a shading building appear on Story 1 in the Project Navigation Tree with no area assigned yet until you draw it. By default, the rectangular tool is selected, but you may switch to the polygon tool if you wish. You may change the height of the shading building at any time. You may always delete a shading building by clicking the “X” next to it. ‌ 7. Utilization Tab You can add a new space, a North : You may rotate the scene which represents the true north displayed on the map. As you rotate the scene, you are rotating true north off of Project North which is always the top of the drawing canvas as can be seen by the compass in the upper left-hand corner of the scene. Story Below : You can enable or disable the display of the story below Map : You may toggle on/off the visibility of the floor below. You are able to snap to the geometry on the story below. Grid : You can toggle on/off the grid display. DXF : You may turn on/off the visibility of the DXF lines in case you have imported one. The drawing tools for spaces do not snap to the DXF as it’s saved as an SVG image. C-Line : Toggle on or off this button to enable or disable the visibility of the construction lines. Spacing : You are able to change the grid spacing and resolution based on the scale of your project. About Length, Width, & Thickness “Length” is associated with the total length of the building in the x-direction, and “width” is the total length of the building in the y-direction when the orientation is set to zero (starting position). These dimensions for each footprint shape may be visualized by hovering your mouse over the building’s 2d view. If the building is rotated, these relative dimensions stay the same. Length: overall length in the x-direction Width: overall length in y-direction Thickness: is automatically calculated in the current Shape Generator 1 mode. Perimeter Depth: is automatically estimated based on the shape and size of your building. It will be defined by users in the future version of the tool. 8. Display Option SPEED provides the user with a wide range of display options. You may toggle on or off the grid, a ground plane, a Google Map.‌ Display Grid : Check or uncheck the box to display or hide the grid. Display Ground : Check or uncheck the box to display or hide the green ground surface. Display Map : In case you had inserted a valid address for “Location” in the “Project Information” tab, you will be able to overlay the map over the ground in the 2D and 3D views. Map Type : This menu is expanded when you check the Display Maps button. You can choose from Google Maps, Google Terrain, Google Satellite, or Google Hybrid maps. 5. Solar Analysis SPEED provides the user with real-time solar analysis. You may activate menus to do rapid, accurate solar analysis for shadow analysis, sunlight hour analysis, and solar radiation analysis with or without a sun path diagram. Display Sun Path : Sun path diagrams provides a broad overview of the sun on a site as they map the path of the sun across the sky at different times during the day throughout the year. They can help establish the position of the sun relative to a site and can be used to visualize the effect of sun and shadows cast by buildings and other structures on and around the site. This option is active if you select Display Shadows, Display Sunlight Hours, or Display Solar Radiation. ‌ Display Shadow : This menu is expanded when you check the Display Shadows button. Shadow analysis is used to determine the shading impacts of the existing and proposed project structures. This feature calculates the shadow lengths of the structures and projects their patterns on buildings and sites at different times of the year. You may move the slider for Hour and see accurate shadows being cast. If you uncheck the Hour button, then you can select a Month and Day and click Run Shadow Analysis, and a sun range diagram will be generated giving you a view of the shadows cast throughout the course of a day. You may click on the zoom icon at the top right of the geometry views to expand the view and shadow analysis inputs. Enable Display Shadow, and remove hours to see shadow ranges ‌ Display Sunlight Hours: This menu is expanded when you check the Display Sunlight Hours button. This analysis calculates the number of hours of direct sunlight received by the building as well as the ground. You can choose if you want the sunlight hour analysis to be annual, seasonal, or for a given month and day. SPEED uses Radiance and an innovative analysis method to generate Radiance results in 95% less time than most other tools with 98% accuracy. ‌ Display Solar Radiation : Solar radiation analysis enables you to map and analyze the effects of the sun over your project for specific time periods. This menu is expanded when you check the Display Solar Radiation button. This insolation analysis calculates the incident solar radiation in kWh/ft2 received by the building as well as the ground and adjacent buildings. You can choose if you want the solar radiation analysis to be annual, seasonal, or for a given month and day. SPEED uses Radiance and an innovative analysis method to generate Radiance results in 95% less time than most other tools with 98% accuracy. ‌",

Building Information Building Area: This is the total building area for your project. As you change inputs like # of Floors and Length/Width building area is maintained.‌ # of Floors : Select a value from 1 to 25 as the number of floors. ‌ Floor Area : This field will be calculated automatically based on the area of the building and the number of floors.‌ Floor Height: Select a value from the list of the floor heights between 8 to 15 feet that is closest to your project. This value should account for the total floor height that is conditioned. For example, if the actual floor to floor height 15 ft, but there are a ceiling and unconditioned plenum that is 3 ft, then the floor height that should be entered is 12 feet. This convention is used to make sure the energy simulation doesn’t overestimate energy consumption. 2. # of Footprint Shape ‌Identify how many footprint shapes you like to compare. When SPEED is in Analysis Type=1 mode, you may compare up to 4 different footprint shapes at once. A minimum of two must be defined. Each footprint shape should be unique. For Analysis Type=2 and Analysis Type=3, only one footprint shape may be defined and this field is deactivated. 3. Massing Generation Footprint Shape : Select from the list of footprint shape closest to your imagined project. The shapes supported by the current version of the tool include Box-Shape, L_Shape, H_Shape, T_Shape, U_Shape, Plus_Shape, Courtyard_Shape. ‌ Orientation: Select building orientation from the list. ‌ Parametric Length/ Width : You can parametrically change the building dimensions for a given footprint shape and building area by varying Length (x) and Width (y) extents, with the thickness auto-calculated to maintain the proper floor area as well as the perimeter depth to ensure reasonable thermal zoning of the model. About Length, Width, & Thickness “Length” is associated with the total length of the building in the x-direction, and “width” is the total length of the building in the y-direction when the orientation is set to zero (starting position). These dimensions for each footprint shape may be visualized by hovering your mouse over the building’s 2d view. If the building is rotated, these relative dimensions stay the same. Length: overall length in the x-direction Width: overall length in y-direction Thickness: is automatically calculated in the current Shape Generator 1 mode. Perimeter Depth: is automatically estimated based on the shape and size of your building. It will be defined by users in the future version of the tool. Opacity : Use the toggle to define your preferred opacity of the building. 4. Display Option SPEED provides the user with a wide range of display options. You may toggle on or off the grid, a ground plane, a Google Map.‌ Display Grid : Check or uncheck the box to display or hide the grid. Display Ground : Check or uncheck the box to display or hide the green ground surface. Display Map : In case you had inserted a valid address for “Location” in the “Project Information” tab, you will be able to overlay the map over the ground in the 2D and 3D views. Map Type : This menu is expanded when you check the Display Maps button. You can choose from Google Maps, Google Terrain, Google Satellite, or Google Hybrid maps. Display or hide ground by checking/unchecking “Display Ground” Display Google Map Display Google Map Sattelite 5. Solar Analysis SPEED provides the user with real-time solar analysis. You may activate menus to do rapid, accurate solar analysis for shadow analysis, sunlight hour analysis, and solar radiation analysis with or without a sun path diagram. Display Sun Path : Sun path diagrams provides a broad overview of the sun on a site as they map the path of the sun across the sky at different times during the day throughout the year. They can help establish the position of the sun relative to a site and can be used to visualize the effect of sun and shadows cast by buildings and other structures on and around the site. This option is active if you select Display Shadows, Display Sunlight Hours, or Display Solar Radiation. ‌ Display Shadow : This menu is expanded when you check the Display Shadows button. Shadow analysis is used to determine the shading impacts of the existing and proposed project structures. This feature calculates the shadow lengths of the structures and projects their patterns on buildings and sites at different times of the year. You may move the slider for Hour and see accurate shadows being cast. If you uncheck the Hour button, then you can select a Month and Day and click Run Shadow Analysis, and a sun range diagram will be generated giving you a view of the shadows cast throughout the course of a day. You may click on the zoom icon at the top right of the geometry views to expand the view and shadow analysis inputs. Enable Display Shadow, and remove hours to see shadow ranges ‌ Display Sunlight Hours: This menu is expanded when you check the Display Sunlight Hours button. This analysis calculates the number of hours of direct sunlight received by the building as well as the ground. You can choose if you want the sunlight hour analysis to be annual, seasonal, or for a given month and day. SPEED uses Radiance and an innovative analysis method to generate Radiance results in 95% less time than most other tools with 98% accuracy. ‌ Display Solar Radiation : Solar radiation analysis enables you to map and analyze the effects of the sun over your project for specific time periods. This menu is expanded when you check the Display Solar Radiation button. This insolation analysis calculates the incident solar radiation in kWh/ft2 received by the building as well as the ground and adjacent buildings. You can choose if you want the solar radiation analysis to be annual, seasonal, or for a given month and day. SPEED uses Radiance and an innovative analysis method to generate Radiance results in 95% less time than most other tools with 98% accuracy. ‌",

They may block solar access and provide shade, modify the path and intensity of airflow, and/or impact glare from the reflection of their surfaces. 1. Add Adjacent Buildings In Parametric Shape Mode, create context buildings by generating a simple box massing at the appropriate distance and direction from the building being designed which is centered at the global origin 0,0,0 using the diagram below as guidance. You can add up to four adjacent buildings. The global axis grid you see assumes positive y is true north. ‌ Consider You can use positive or negative values for Offset X and Offset Y, compared to the global axis. Length, width, and height can get any integer values Select the orientation of each context building from the list of Site Orientation You can zoom in or out inside the Site Context visualization to adjust the view. 2. Display Options SPEED provides the user with a range of display options throughout your project. You may toggle on or off the grid, a ground plane, and a Google Map Overlay. If you check the Map box, a menu will appear where you can choose from Google Maps Street, Google Maps Satellite, or Google Maps Hybrid map types. If the latitude and longitude obtained from the Project Information Page don’t put your geometry grid in exactly the right location, you may move the map overlay to exactly position the center of your building by pressing the Ctrl button and holding the right-click button, and dragging the map in the 2D view.",

    "content": "What is SPEED? Why did we create SPEED? Who is the SPEED team? How does SPEED “fit within our design process? SPEED Project Portal Page SPEED General Structure of Pages SPEED Project Information Page SPEED Site Context SPEED Geometry Page - Parametric Shapes SPEED Geometry Page - BST SPEED Envelope Page SPEED Construction Page SPEED Space Layout Page SPEED Space Load Page SPEED HVAC Page SPEED Daylighting Page SPEED Photovoltaic Page SPEED Parametric Study SPEED Result: Single Run Chart SPEED Result: Multiple Run Chart SPEED Result: PCP SPEED Result: 2D Scatter Plot SPEED Result: 3D Scatter Plot SPEED Result: Sensitivity Analysis SPEED Result: 3D Parameter Influence About Instructions Result Tutorials Examples FAQ Project Information The Project Information page provides all the high-level information about your project to get things going. ‌ 1. Location Address : SPEED uses a Google Maps API using the address typed in by the user to automatically look important information about the project site for energy and daylighting analysis. First, SPEED looks up the latitude and longitude of the site which is used to (1) identify the most appropriate weather file to use for the simulation from a Department of Energy database; (2) place the center point of the building at the grid global origin (0,0,0) at that latitude and longitude; and (3) is used to scale a Google Map Overlay on the grid in the following pages. The Country, State, and Zip Code are automatically populated and the Zip Code is used to (1) lookup the ASHRAE Climate Zone and Energy Code to be used for prescriptive code-compliant constructions R-Values and space loads such as Lighting Power Density and (2) the fuel factors, emission rates, and utility rates for that region using a tool called eGrid. You might see several drop downs appear once you start typing in an address. One is from the Google Maps API and one is from your local browser (it’s the thinner drop-down menu). Make sure to select from the Google Maps API and not your browser. Country : USA and Canada now, all the other countries where we have offices or projects will be added soon.‌ State and City : Auto-populated! Just for your reference.‌ Zip Code : The Zip Code of your project is very important. With this input as well as Country and State, SPEED automatically (1) looks up the ASHRAE Climate Zone and Energy Code to be used for automatically looking up prescriptive code constructions and space loads; and (2) looks up the fuel factors, emission rates, and utility rates for that region. Energy Code : Right now we only support ASHRAE 90.1-2007/2010/2013. If you wish to use a more stringent version of ASHRAE 90.1 than is currently required for your location, you may do so by unchecking “Default” and selecting the desired one.  If a state uses IECC as the required code, it’s very close to the ASHRAE ones and we just use the best fit. The next step will be to allow for all sorts of Energy Codes to be used such as Title 24 in California or whatever other code all of you want and need for your project. 2. Project Profile Project Name : The Project Profile is a brief snapshot describing your project, including Project Name, Project Description, your preferred Unit system, and Primary Building Type. Since you logged into SPEED with Okta, it knows what projects you have access to given your home office. These are the projects that will appear in the drop-down menu. Since SPEED is free to project teams, the Project Name is only used as a reference. If you are in pursuit or prefer not to use a specific Project Name, you may select the options “Test” or “Pursuit”. The Project Description is only used for your own personal summary and to more easily identify your project in the Project Portal. For Units, we currently only support IP, though SI will be supported in the next release. Project Description : This field is not used by SPEED for anything other than providing the designers with a useful description in the Project Portal Page.‌ Units : This field can be IP or SI units. The IP option is the only one available for the first version, but soon the SI option will be available as well. ‌ Primary Building Type : The Primary Building Type is the building’s main function that will strongly influence its design and operation and is used to determine the number of assumptions in SPEED. For offices, a Small Office is <50,000 ft2, a Medium Office is 50,000 ft2 ≥ X < 100,000 ft2, and a Large Office is ≥ 100,000 ft2. Later in the Space Layout page, you will have the ability to specify multi-use building details. Note Originally, we had each Project Billing Number appear with the Project Name. This was because we thought the project may get billed for the time/cost of using AWS for their simulations. But thanks to how quickly and inexpensively we can run simulations (500 energy simulations cost $6!), our CEO Phil decided to make this a free service to all its designers. Thanks, Phil!! 3. Performance Benchmarks and Targets Having a building’s Energy Use Intensity (EUI) benchmark is the first step to understanding and comparing your energy performance and carbon footprint to a similar existing building stock. Based on the benchmark, energy performance targets such as Architecture 2030 may be determined. Click on the link for EUI Generator to obtain these values based on the building type, size, and climate conditions. While these inputs are not required, they are very useful later in SPEED as you may visualize them alongside the performance of the designs you choose to analyze. EUI Benchmark/Target: Though not required, if you enter this information here, we can show them in the visualizations of the results of your project so you know how your designs compare to your benchmarks and targets! Please let us know what other building performance benchmarks and targets you’d like to see here…energy is only the starting point. About Length, Width, & Thickness Most input fields that are to be typed in by the user are NOT required. You may leave them blank and complete the page without filling them in. These fields are used for your reference only. 4. Geometry Mode SPEED was designed to give designers flexibility in how they create their building geometry. Select Parametric Shapes if you would like to generate geometry using up to 4 pre-defined footprints (e.g. “L”, “H”, etc.) that may be parametrically driven using a few simple inputs. Select Block & Stack Tool if you would like to draw custom geometry for up to 4 footprint shapes. The final option, Import gbXML , allows you to import up to 4 massings from Sketch-Up, Rhino, or Revit. Depending on what Geometry Mode you select, the entire Graphical User Interface (GUI) is put into several different modes to optimize how you create your project, simulate it, and evaluate the results. For example, in BST Mode, no Site Context or Space Layout Page appears since shading buildings and Space Type assignments are all done within the Geometry Page. Parametric Shapes: Depending on the project and design stage, you will want to choose the appropriate analysis types for your SPEED project. Each Analysis Type enables/disables different features to ensure that your parametric study at the end of your project is giving you the most useful results.‌ Comparing Multiple Footprint Shapes Together (Type 1) : This option should be selected if the building footprint shape is not yet fixed and you want to explore the energy performance of various massing shapes side-by-side. When the tool is in this mode, some inputs are limited to be able to isolate the impact of the different footprint shapes. For example, the user can only assign one Space Type to the entire building to isolate the energy impacts of the different shapes and prevent the energy output metrics from reflecting different internal loads and number of zones rather than the different building forms. When we say Fixed Footprint Dimensions , we don’t actually mean you can change the relative dimensions of the Footprint Shape. You most certainly can. We just mean that in the Parametric Study, you will not be able to make the input design variables Length and Width a part of the study. Comparing Different Number of Floors for a Fixed Footprint Shape (Type 2) : This option should be selected if the building footprint shape is fixed but you want to evaluate the impact of varying the number of floors on building performance. In this mode, while some inputs are limited, it is less restrictive than Analysis Type=1, such as enabling the assignment of different space types to multiple floors in the model. Comparing Different Massing Aspect Ratios for a Fixed Footprint Shape and # of Floors (Type 3): This option should be selected if the building footprint shape is fixed as well as the number of floors. There are no restrictions on inputs in this third mode, and footprint dimensions may be included in the parametric study. A graphical way of summarizing the various Analysis Types. ‌ Block & Stack Tool (BST): If you cannot create your geometry from the current footprint shape in the parametric shapes mode, you would be able to create your own specific geometry by selecting the BST tool.‌ gbXML Import: This functionality has yet to be built into SPEED, but will be included in the next several releases.",

Project ID: Each designer will have their projects named like this: FirstNameLastName-1,2,3, etc.‌ 2 . Project Name: This comes directly from Okta. Once you log in, Okta determines which projects you have access to select from. Based on user feedback, we now have an option to simply select “Test Project” or “Pursuit” at the top of the list. This is because often Pursuits have not made their way to Okta yet, but it’s one of the most valuable phases of design to use SPEED! ‌ 3 . Date Completed: This is the date that the Status field was completed. ‌ 4 . Total Submitted Runs: This is the total size of your design space, i.e. how many runs or simulations you had in your project.‌ 5 . Total Successful Runs: Hopefully this matches (4), but sometimes it won’t. Fear not. Some runs can fail and your study is still valid and useful. Our cut-off for whether or not say a project is successful or not is if less than 10% fail.‌ 6 . Status: The options are (1) Draft; (2) Submitted for Analysis; (3) Analysis in Progress; (4) Simulation Complete; (5) Analysis Complete (meaning we did some post-processing on the simulation results to give you some useful design guidance); and (6) Analysis Failed. We hope you don’t get the last one, but it will happen, particularly during the first months. We have a lot of kinks to work out. If your project fails, someone will get in contact with you directly to explain why we think it failed, and what needs to happen for you to successfully re-submit it.‌ 7 . Project Description: This is for your own reference. If you have a pursuit, you’ll probably want to put the name in this field, which is discussed later.‌ 8 . View, Copy, or Share : By selecting View, you can open up old projects, finish them or view their results (unless it’s still running). You can copy a project and modify it for new sets of analysis. Or you can share a project with another PW user, which will have all information except the results. Note If you open up a project that has been submitted or is complete, the GUI inputs are disabled so you can still see them but not change them.‌ 9 . Add Project/ Demo : If you want to create a new project, click the “Add Project” button. If you want to see an example of what a successfully completed project looks like, click the “Demo” button.",

Section 3 Model Drawing & CAD Management 3.1 – Approaches to model Management 3.1.1 – Please indicate the drawing and Model / CAD modelling approaches that are used in your organisation. Globally Perkins&Will have a firmwide mandate to utilise parametric modelling methods. This is complemented by a variety of design approaches from hand sketching, surface modelling, computational design, visualisation and physical printed model. 3.1.2 – Provide an approximation of the proportion of your outputs that use each method in a typical year. UK BIM Authoring – 45% Concept Surface Modelling – 15% 2D CAD – 30% Hand Sketches / Visualisation – 10% This is based on the last calendar year. The focus is to convert the office fully to BIM Authoring at a minimum of the next 2 years. 3.2 BIM / CAD Standards 3.2.1 – A re sta n dards us e d to produce y o ur C A D / B IM m ode l s? Yes – Modelling standards are documented on the company intranet and built into a PW template. BEP’s will also refer to project-specific modelling standards in accordance with the project deliverables. 3.2.2. – If y o u d o n ot w ork to a C A D / B IM S t a nda r d. W h y n ot? – N/A 3.2.3 – Do you work to the standards outlined in the EIR document? – Yes 3.2.4 – If your standards differ from those outlined in the EIR document, what are they based upon? – N/A 3.2.5 – How do you demonstrate or what measures do you have in place to ensure compliance with your CAD / BIM Standard ? Each project is assigned a BIM Coordinator that verifies that the models authored internally to comply with both internal BIM standards and also align with the project BEP. This is part of the model coordinators designated role on any project. 3.2.6 – Do you produce a BIM as an iterative process? e.g. the Plan of Work stages. Yes in accordance with the RIBA POW but not always from the very early stages of design 3.2.7 – Please confirm your Quality Management System allows you to adopt the Employer’s CAD standards including title blocks, file naming conventions, version controls if required? Yes – subject to review 3.2.8 – How do you carry out spatial co-ordination using CAD / BIM? Virtual Design + Construction methods are applied during early design stages with formal coordination workshops being carried out at identified project stage timelines. The frequency of these workshops increases as we move into Stage 4 (Technical Design). Less formal coordination working in a model environment is encouraged as the way we work with design team partners. 3.2.9 – In a single paragraph please explain your experiences with linked, attached and embedded attribute data within 3D models Geometric elements have the ability to be populated with additional data providing the “Information” associated with BIM. Embedded data allows the building model to move beyond typical 3D geometry and move into further dimensions of time cost and asset information. (4/5/6D) Section 4 Experience with Electronic Data Exchange 4.1 – Web-Based Project Tools 4.1.1 – Please indicate your experience with web-based project tools such as extranets or web-enabled document management systems.

If third party consultants are used, please provide details. In house with the exception of some visualisation above Section 6 – Industry Foundation Class (IFC) 6.1 – IFC Experience 6.1.1 – Briefly describe your experience of using IFC as a file exchange format. Perkins&Will UK have used IFC on projects to supply FM teams with an open-source format for use with digital O&M manuals. We have also used IFC as an open format for collaboration but this wasn’t without its challenges. Processes had to be refined to ensure models when exchanged were fit for purpose notably when the exchange was between differing software authoring tools. Section 7 – IT Resillience 7.1 – Disaster Recovery Systems & Procedures 7.1.1-Briefly describe your disaster recovery systems and procedures. Being part of a global company, we start from a position of all essential Active Directory and other services being replicated at offices across North America, Brazil, London, Paris, Dubai, and Shanghai. VPN connections are managed by Sprint and are routed inbound through their POPs, so users can VPN into other offices. Internal systems are also replicated to a co-location site in Chicago. Email services are hosted externally by Microsoft. We use Nasuni cloud filers which push all changes to cloud storage, and the volumes are also replicated to other Nasuni filers around the globe so that in the event of a loss of a filer users are connected to a surviving filer through DFS. The loss of a single office should, therefore, have minimal impact on data processing capabilities. All staff have laptops rather than desktops so a large number could be expected to have their laptops with them. 7.1.2 – Briefly describe your archiving systems and procedures. Our use of the Nasuni filer means we are able to keep all information online. It is stored in the cloud storage part of the filter, and pulled into the onsite cache when needed. This means we currently don’t archive any material offline, but move it to a different tier of storage instead. 7.1.3 – Do you have an anti virus system that continuously monitors all your incoming and outgoing traffic? Provide details. Yes, we use Microsoft SCCM for virus scanning. 7.1.4 – How often do you update your anti virus software? – Constantly via automatic updates 7.1.5 – Do you have systems for protecting against spyware and other covert activity logging systems? – Yes, we use SCCM for desktop protection 7.1.6 – Do you have a firewall system, is it mainstream and are there limitations / Outgoing & Incoming ? Yes, Dell Sonicwall firewalls, no limitations. Section 8 – Contectural Understanding 8.1 – Primary BIM Uses 8.1.1-Design Construction Intelligent 3D modelling – Architectural Evidence – Our approach to design using BIM at Perkins&Will involves complete integration. The 3D model is our primary design tool. BIM tools provides the ability to explore ideas quickly within context, and allow our designers to occupy, interact with, and experience the space/building while creating it. The design experience is deepened through lighting studies, various forms of environmental analysis, and exploration of new geometries, forms, and textures. Building Information Models are used to develop and deliver all design documentation, including plans, sections, elevations, axonometric and perspective views of projects by using a series of firmwide standard and real-world elements to enable consistent outputs. Data is embedded within these elements that can be extracted and re-used by members of the construction team and FM managers when the building is in operation. Project partners often dictate how active our use of collaborative BIM methods are but we look to team up in any way possible and often provide assistance and support to our project partners who are new to working this way. PBPW has implemented the above on a number of collaborative projects including projects that have developed As Constructed models and links to FM data systems moving through RIBA Stages 1-6. 8.1.2-Facillities Management Perkins&Will have worked with FM providers to understand the requirements and provide the relevant fields for contractor embedded information. Using a geometric model that is imported into the providers software, links have been provided to enable preventive scheduled maintenance and digital connection to O&M and warranty data. We have also provided COBIE data but are unsure if use was made of the information delivered. 8.1.2-Quantity Take Off / Costing Perkins&Will model to allow for cost information to be scheduled via take off from the model. Not every building element is modeled but what is and what is not modelled will be written into the MPS. We model as much as possible to allow us to both quantify as a means of validation and to ensure that access pinch points are accurate and finishes are represented as true model elements. 8.1.4-Visualsisation / Marketing Visuals, walkthroughs and 3D printed replicas can be can be relatively simple to extract from the models and can be used as effective communication tools. These model bi-products help the client and team better understand the proposed design. Because the model is live, renderings can be easily developed at all phases of the design providing the client with a tangible visual product before construction begins. Our models are used as a baseline for our visualisation teams when high end marketing imagery / animation is required. 8.1.5-Safety Planning – N/A 8.1.6-Clash Detection – Perkins&Will utilise a VD+C Workflow through the design stages to ensure that design models are coordinated between disciplines prior to hand over to construction contractors. These workshops help validate against the MPS table to ensure that model information is as described. Clash rules are set dependent upon project stage. Initially as identifying simple hard clashes but as the project moves into the final stages of technical design the clash rule sets becoming more defined to include access, install and service space requirements. We use clash validation to ensure our design intent documentation is constructible rather than target a zero clash model. 8.1.7-4D Scheduling – While as designers we do not implement 4D during construction we often add the time dimension into our design via the project phasing tools built into our authoring software. This is more appropriate when working on a renovation of in use existing estate. 8.1.8-Construction BIM – N/A 8.1.9-Procurement – N/A 8.1.10-Supply Chain Management – N/A 8.1.11-Simulation- Perkins&Will use BIM tools and 3rd party plug-ins to analyses / verify and optioneer throughout the design process. We find these tools most useful in the early stages of a project enabling us to review building orientation, glazing types, shading options, carbon emissions and daylight simulation. Our tools are also accredited for compliance against UK statutory requirements. Using these tools give us confidence that our designs are robust and can provide a solid foundation for more detailed engineering analysis provided by our design partners. 8.1.12-Research & Education- Perkins&Will supports small, focused explorations proposed by staff members with micro-grants of money and time through the Innovation Incubator program. Innovation Incubator provides opportunities for proactive idea investigation, technical development, and design collaboration. The results of these explorations further our design work and contribute to the knowledge base of our industry. AREA is a non-profit research organization, which conducts research related to the built environment for the benefit of the public interest. Our vision is to engage in scientific research that results in a higher quality of the built environment, and by extension, the lives of its inhabitants. Our mission is to provide a platform that bridges traditional research disciplines and design through collaborative research efforts and the acquisition of research funding. The Perkins&Will Research Journal is dedicated to documenting and presenting practice-related research associated with buildings, their occupants and their environs. The aim of this journal is to capture and document research questions and methodologies that arise prior, during and after the design process. Section 9 – Project Experience Provide details of a minimum of 3 BIM projects for use as reference. Section 10 – Further Supporting Statements Please use this section should you wish to append any further supporting statements or clarifications. Evolution of BIM Much of the recent evolution in our BIM approach has been focused on cultivating a building information ecosystem by aggregating data sources and tailoring information delivery to downstream processes. The original promise of BIM is the creation and management of information-rich digital representations of buildings — 3d geometrical models containing all of the information necessary for the building design and construction process. Over the course of BIM’s evolution, a few things have become clear: The information required in the design and construction process exceeds the amount of information that can be easily or efficiently managed through a single BIM authoring application; The information required in planning, programming, and design processes is not exactly the same data needed to fabricate building components or assemble a building, and requires a different approach to information management; A combination of design and construction data, complemented by operational data, is highly valuable to building owners and facilities managers beyond construction. Data-centric delivery Beginning with our healthcare practice, we have created program databases, which represent a “single source of truth” for storing and managing information about a facility. These program databases are then linked to other databases that manage medical equipment, furniture, fixtures, mechanical equipment, special construction, as well as design knowledge, all of which are connected with our Building Information Models. The information contained in these databases can be delivered strategically, throughout the life of the project, including into building operations. Post Construction BIM Properly developed, the Building Information Model and ancillary databases become an asset that is transferred from phase to phase and built upon as more information is gathered to ultimately help the client to maintain their facilities. Facilities management database practices vary widely from project to project. Some clients prefer a basic spatial database that supports lifecycle assessments for capital investments such as renovations, long or short term planning. Other clients require complete equipment inventories with detailed parameters such as asset numbers, warranty information, and condition assessments. Due to the wide range of potential needs, we work with our clients to identify their unique facilities management data needs and create a clear vision of how they intend to manage their facilities in the future. Design Analytics While many of our practices have long maintained sophisticated analytical capabilities, we are now also developing new processes for data gathering and analysis, which are proving successful in our planning practices, both at the workplace scale and the campus or urban scale. In one example, we have developed a mobile application that makes polling and data gathering by our workplace team more dynamic and less intrusive. Survey queries can be served individually and strategically, over a broader timeframe, and keyed to locational triggers through Bluetooth beacons. This technology allows user polling to be seamlessly integrated into the workplace or urban environment. Using both internally developed and freely available data analysis and visualization resources, we are able to provide a rich source of information and knowledge that improves design decisions, as well as our clients’ operations. Management Intelligence Perkins&Will project teams and firm management all operate across multiple software platforms and applications, for design, delivery, project management, collaboration, communication, human resources, and financial management. Taking queues from business intelligence and analytics, we have been working to extract and federate data across these disparate platforms in order to analyze and view aggregated information. “Dashboard” type data visualizations, which we use to manage our projects and to communicate with our clients, offer insight in to project health, success, progress in terms of our key performance metrics. In addition, it gives firm leadership the ability to quickly take data snapshots of the firm’s operational health. This capability has enabled our leadership and our clients to see and to manage progress in ways never before available.",

    "content": "As a global firm Perkins&Will have a fully connected infrastructure that allows us to interact seamlessly within the Perkins & Will framework of studios. Our fully mobile solution not only means our live data is available anywhere and everywhere, avoiding data duplication, coordination issues and rework but also enables us to resource projects globally, leveraging experience and expertise from across the firm. This solution can be extended beyond our internal infrastructure and into a “project cloud” or “virtual project office” where dedicated project stakeholders can gain access to live and secure information from any location ensuring a single source of truth for all project data. As our standard practice is of model-based project delivery we carry out our design coordination in a 3D environment to ensure design intent is in-line with the project program and fully coordinated prior to being handed to a constructor during the pre-construction phase. Typically we use a coordination tool that federates stakeholder models from which we can validate our designs collaboratively issuing resolution actions and responsibilities in a controlled process to help identify issues in a transparent way to the whole team. These coordination meetings are often run virtually over our Microsoft Teams with project partners having the ability to control and author what is being shared collaboratively from any location with an Internet connection. We would schedule out the frequency of these coordination workshops along with the agreed processes detailing the methods of collating the models, agreeing file formats, clash rules, and reporting methods as part of a project plan. Perkins&Will also has a platinum subscription contract with Autodesk and we have access to the collaborative platforms that are being currently provided via the BIM 360 suite such as Revit Model Cloud in BIM360 Design, BIM360 Build, and BIM360 Coordinate all supported on top of BIM360 Docs. *** Note – Prior to agreeing to use any 3rd party cloud-based collaboration platforms please check with your local DA or reach out to Digital Practice to ensure these products are compatible with our own internal systems.",

    "content": "In the UK the request for a BIM policy statement along with a supplier capability set of questions is becoming a more frequent request as it aligns with the Level 2 Govt procedures. I have drafted this based on the BIM Statement page. Purpose This statement is intended to detail Perkins&Will's firmwide attitude and approach towards BIM methods. This document is reviewed regularly and is circulated to all production staff. BIM Baseline Statement Building Information Modeling (BIM) is fundamental to our collaborative design approach. BIM enables team communication and collaboration, disciplinary integration, and systems coordination. BIM allows us to more fully evaluate design, planning, and performance options; to actively participate in the value analysis of alternative design decisions, and to improve the coordination and quality of our services. Effective design and delivery depend on sound decisions, and our BIM process enables faster, more-informed design-making by our teams and clients. We have been committed to BIM globally since 2006, and during this time, we have delivered hundreds of BIM projects. With a robust technology toolbox and a deep knowledge base, we continue to provide project solutions that efficiently and intelligently address client needs. Our UK operation has been utilizing BIM methods in accordance with the recent industry acceleration and UK Government BIM mandate. Our workflows align with that of the mandate in regard to sharing information on a common platform collaborating to help bring teams together and avoiding rework and uncoordinated information. Commitment We see the intelligent application of technology as the enabler of a high-performing, interdisciplinary design organization. As such, our commitment to BIM starts with our firm's leaders and permeates our organization, down to each team and individual. This document has been authored by our firmwide digital practice team in collaboration with Leadership and approved by our head of Engineering Excellence. The digital practice team possesses a broad understanding of design practice and process, coupled with technical proficiency and significant depth in one or more Digital Practice domains: Digital Project Delivery; Design Computation; Analysis, Simulation & Visualization; and Information Management. Collectively, the team has managed technology, BIM implementation, planning, and execution on some of Perkins&Will’s largest, most complex projects across all market sectors. Implementing the strategies associated with this document are the responsibility of Digital Practice, local Design Application Managers and project BIM leads. Project leaders are also required to implement this strategy on BIM projects. Project Implementation We emphasize the planning and management of the BIM process throughout the life of the project. Each project has a dedicated BIM Coordinator who works with the project team at project outset to define a project-specific BIM Execution Plan, which clarifies the intended uses of the model, the roles and responsibilities of team members, and the protocols for data exchange between team members. Looking forward, Perkins&Will is pushing our practice beyond BIM’s baseline as a design, documentation, and collaboration tool because we recognize that the wealth of building, construction, and operational information developed with BIM is highly valuable to our project partners and owners. As such, our approach to Digital Practice facilitates a comprehensive and collaborative project delivery method that begins in project pre-planning and can continue through building operation.

    "content": "This statement is intended to be a comprehensive, yet modular, statement of Perkins&Will’s attitude and approach toward BIM. It is a compilation of several documents. It is not intended to be used in its entirety, but rather as a resource that contains language to address a variety of requests. BIM and Design Technology at Perkins&Will Baseline BIM We have established ourselves as industry leaders in BIM by pioneering its adoption and implementation in our design processes. At the heart of our collaborative design approach lies Building Information Modeling (BIM), which enables our teams to communicate and collaborate seamlessly, integrate disciplines, and coordinate systems effectively. With our extensive experience and deep understanding of BIM’s capabilities, we are able to evaluate design, planning, and performance options thoroughly and engage in value analysis of alternative design decisions. BIM empowers us to improve coordination and service quality, making effective design and delivery possible. Our commitment to innovation and excellence in BIM has been recognized by our peers and clients alike, cementing our reputation as leaders in this field. Philosophy We see the intelligent application of technology as the enabler of a high-performing, interdisciplinary design organization. As such, our commitment to BIM starts with our firm’s leaders and permeates our organization, down to each team and individual. Looking forward, Perkins&Will is pushing our practice beyond BIM’s baseline as a design, documentation, and collaboration tool because we recognize that the wealth of building, construction, and operational information developed with BIM is highly valuable to our project partners and owners. As such, our approach to Digital Practice facilitates a comprehensive and collaborative project delivery method that begins in project pre-planning and can continue through building operation. Typical BIM Uses Space Planning: Multiple plan and adjacency configurations are quickly explored to provide the client with options to review and approve during the design phases. Programmatic Prototyping: The model will generate detailed room data sheets used to convey room layouts showing all furniture, fixtures and utilities for the engineers and users to review and approve. This is now live information tied to the actual plans. We can also re-design spaces in real-time with the faculty to make the design process more effective and enjoyable. Site & Context Design: Existing Site Conditions will be modeled so the design can respond to building orientation on the site and context. Site prep, site improvements and utilities are then developed from these conditions at all phases of design. Conceptual Massing: The building massing will be studied in 3D to quickly convey composition and context during the design phases. Design Visualization: Renderings help clients and team better understand the proposed design and are a good resource for fundraising activities. Because the model is “live,” continually reflecting the latest state of design, renderings it can be easily developed at all phases. Environmental Analysis: Exterior response to daylight, energy consumption and computational fluid dynamic analysis is developed using the model to better inform the engineering systems related to actual energy needs and consumption. We can demonstrate ways to reduce capital and operating cost by use of building elements such as shading devices. Quantity Verification: The model database provides quantities which allow the design team, architects and engineers, to validate scope with the cost estimates and the contractor beginning as early as the first two weeks of the project and throughout the entire design phase. We have also successfully used BIM quantities during bid interviews to confirm scope. The model will be used to generate schedules for all equipment and devices based on the database which eliminates data entry errors. Advanced Collaboration: Frequent exchange of models between architecture and engineering disciplines allows an almost real-time degree of coordination at all times and facilitates QA/QC. With automatic uploads on a defined periodic basis, as often as daily, everyone sees what the other person is developing across the entire team. The model is also shared with the construction manager for better integration between design and construction. The construction team not only uses this information for estimating but more importantly for constructability and sequence of construction input so the design can be improved before it is completed. Perkins&Will and our consultants will work side by side with the CM and prime subcontractors to capitalize on all the attributes the BIM can bring to your project to minimize risk and to provide the best value. Systems and Design Coordination: BIM offers the ability to identify conflicts between modeled building systems and to document and resolve these conflicts during design. This process begins as early as there is sufficient information in the model, usually during design development. This process reduces the amount of RFIs during construction. The most effective approach is to include the design team and construction team in this review to further integrate the team towards holistic and cost-effective solutions. At the conclusion of design the BIM model can be delivered to the construction team to help accelerate the initial phases of contract documents, construction and coordination with their sub-contractors. BIM Planning We emphasize the planning and management of the BIM process throughout the life of the project. At the start of the project, we develop a project-specific BIM Plan, which clarifies the intended uses of the model, the roles and responsibilities of team members, and the protocols for data exchange between team members. When contractors are integrated into the project team, we encourage their participation in the development of the plan. This allows the model to be used jointly by the design and construction teams. The BIM Plan defines the following items: Model use: How the model will be used at each stage of the project’s design and construction. Levels of development: The level of modeling detail of building components for each phase. Collaboration and communications protocols: The exchange of electronic information and collaboration procedures. Analysis plan: How the model will support other analysis platforms to enable the project team to make informed decisions. Non-graphic data: Specific information including area tabulations, equipment lists, and similar data, to be extracted from the model to inform project team decision-making. Quality assurance: Procedures to ensure the model contains the information appropriate for the design of the project. Technology infrastructure: Hardware, software, and network infrastructure required to execute the plan and maintain the model. Digital Practice and Design Computation Successful BIM relies on people, including proficient project teams and dedicated design-technology specialists. Perkins&Will’s Digital Practice team works across Perkins&Will’s projects and practices to enable a high-performing, interdisciplinary design organization and culture through the intelligent and effective application of technology. This team possesses a broad understanding of design practice and process, coupled with technical proficiency and significant depth in one or more of Digital Practice domains: Digital Project Delivery; Design Computation; Analysis, Simulation & Visualization; and Information Management. The Digital Practice team works with project leadership on technology strategy, integrated Building Information Modeling (BIM) and design technology planning, and workflow implementation for design and project execution. Collectively, the team has managed technology, BIM implementation, planning, and execution on some of Perkins&Will’s largest, most complex projects across all market sectors. Emerging technologies also enable us to creatively address the complexities of the design process by building new tools. Our firmwide network of design computation specialists expands our design teams’ resources beyond the scope of commercially-available software packages. Our ability to engage in parametric modeling, iterative simulation, design optimization, and application customization through scripting and software programming offers our clients’ uniquely agile and attentive design teams. New technological exploration is always anchored by Perkins&Will’s broad and deep practice expertise. Infrastructure Built for Collaboration Perkins&Will has developed an advanced technology infrastructure to support engagement among our teams, our collaborators, and our clients. In 2009, Perkins&Will designed and implemented internal computational “clouds” that provide the computational power and bandwidth needed to develop and manage large, complex project models and datasets. These secure clouds also play a vital collaborative role at Perkins&Will by creating virtual hubs that allow distributed client, design, and construction teams to meet and work together. This infrastructure makes Perkins&Will uniquely capable of integrating and coordinating large, extended teams that are either physically co-located or geographically distributed. Design Software Our suite of design software includes numerous interoperable applications in addition to our primary BIM authoring application, Autodesk Revit. Additional primary applications include  McNeel’s Rhino 3D for conceptual modeling. We also use a series of support applications and “plug-ins” developed by third-party vendors and our own applications developers. We are actively engaged with major software vendors to inform, test, and in some cases, co-develop the next generation of AEC software applications. Perkins&Will uses advanced analysis tools for energy, daylighting and comfort studies. Honeybee/Ladybug is an environmental plugin for Rhino 3d. Revit geometry is imported into Rhino for analysis in the Honeybee/Ladybug plug-in. Honeybee/Ladybug provides a variety of 3D interactive graphics to support the decision-making process during the initial stages of design. It provides rapid feedback to give architects a stronger understanding of their decisions on energy and cost performance. Honeybee/Ladybug helps architects to understand and optimize the performance of a set of building massing parameters through an energy demand and daylight analysis. Project Information Management Accurate record keeping is crucial to managing design team information, and using technology to communicate, store, and index information efficiently is vital for project success; therefore, we utilize a suite of web-based tools throughout the project lifecycle for communication, decision-making, and teamwork, including project timeline strategy, design coordination, CCA, punchlist, and archival, on both mobile and desktop versions. Advanced BIM Beyond our baseline use of building information modeling for design, documentation, and collaboration, BIM information enables a number of more advanced capabilities from which complex projects can benefit. As part of the planning process for each project, we define with the client a customized approach for using BIM. Some of the advanced uses of BIM include the following: Note: This section needs updating Operations Simulation Modeling Tests and validates design options Evaluates programmatic efficiencies Set-Based Design Methodology Allows concurrent development of multiple design options Allows continuous real-time cost/benefit comparisons Virtual Prototyping Facilitates prefabrication and modularization Standardizes program spaces for operation efficiency Facility Management Supports progressive scheduled maintenance Optimizes operation of building systems Evolution of BIM Much of the recent evolution in our BIM approach has been focused on cultivating a building information ecosystem by aggregating data sources and tailoring information delivery to downstream processes. The original promise of BIM is the creation and management of information rich digital representations of buildings — 3d geometrical models containing all of the information necessary for the building design and construction process.

Data-centric delivery Beginning with our healthcare practice, we have created program databases, which represent a “single source of truth” for storing and managing information about a facility. These program databases are then linked to other databases that manage medical equipment, furniture, fixtures, mechanical equipment, special construction, as well as design knowledge, all of which are connected with our Building Information Models. The information contained in these databases can be delivered strategically, throughout the life of the project, including into building operations. Post Construction BIM Properly developed, the Building Information Model and ancillary databases becomes an asset that is transferred from phase to phase and built upon as more information is gathered to ultimately help the client to maintain their facilities. Facilities management database practices vary widely from project to project. Some clients prefer a basic spatial database that supports lifecycle assessments for capital investments such as renovations, long or short term planning. Other clients require complete equipment inventories with detailed parameters such as asset numbers, warranty information, and condition assessments. Due to the wide range of potential needs, we work with our clients to identify their unique facilities management data needs and create a clear vision of how they intend to manage their facilities in the future. Design Analytics While many of our practices, have long maintained sophisticated analytical capabilities, we are now also developing new processes for data gathering and analysis, which are proving successful in our planning practices, both at the workplace scale and the campus or urban scale. In one example, we have developed a mobile application that makes polling and data gathering by our workplace team more dynamic and less intrusive. Survey queries can be served individually and strategically, over a broader timeframe, and keyed to locational triggers through bluetooth beacons. This technology allows user polling to be seamlessly integrated into the workplace or urban environment. Using both internally developed and freely available data analysis and visualization resources, we are able to provide a rich source of information and knowledge that improves design decisions, as well as our clients’ operations. Management Intelligence Perkins&Will project teams and firm management all operate across multiple software platforms and applications, for design, delivery, project management, collaboration, communication, human resources, and financial management . Taking queues from business intelligence and analytics, we have been working to extract and federate data across these disparate platforms in order to analyze and view aggregated information. “Dashboard” type data visualizations, which we use to manage our projects and to communicate with our clients, offer insight in to project health, success, progress in terms of our key performance metrics. In addition, it give firm leadership the ability to quickly take data snapshots of the firm’s operational health. This capability has enabled our leadership and our clients to see and to manage progress in ways never before available. TL;DR Building Information Modeling has been fundamental to Perkins&Will’s collaborative design approach since 2006. We use BIM to streamline our design and delivery processes, as well as to enable interdisciplinary design coordination, visualization, and analysis to facilitate decisions by the client and design team. Perkins&Will executes BIM projects through a suite of software applications and a collection of supporting tools for conceptual and computational design, energy and environmental analysis, and visualization.",

    "content": "Budget Cards Budget Cards are quick-glance metrics displayed at the top of the Staffing module. They are designed to alert you to the health of the project. Each displaying the latest Vision data as it relates to project labor vs the plan. Hide Budget Cards Sometimes you may need to clear up screen space for planning purposes. Budget Cards are visible by default, but can be hidden by sliding this toggle. Target Labor Budget Card (no budget) Budget Card displays NA until you provide more information in the Budget. Cards will continue to say “Target” until the budget approved. Target Labor Budget Card (approved budget) The Target Labor Budget Card may appear full prior to Budget Approval. This is the likely view you are building a “top down” plan where you develop a budget first then staff hours second. In this scenario, your labor bucket is full and shows 100% of the planned bucket available to draw from. As you add hours to your Roles or People, the Labor Budget will reduce. It will go down to 0 to show you balanced. As you add more hours and thus cost and go past your target this will show negative and turn red once you are more than 5% past your target. Approved Labor Budget Card Shows Approved Labor Budget (fixed) vs Planned Labor Budget. The label of this card changes from ‘Target’ to ‘Approved’ after you have submitted your budget and gotten approval. In this example, the Budget has been approved and is set at $153,505. The PM has gotten approval with a top-down plan and now needs to assign all their hours to People or Roles. This project has not assigned more hours for people than the cost allowed in the plan, so the Budget Card appears green. Unbalanced Labor Budget Card In this example, the Budget has been approved and is set at $400,920, but has been over-planned by $26,800. The Budget Card appears White to indicate that the Budget is over budget by less than 5% and to reduce your labor or adjust the plan. Planned Labor is at least 10 % higher than the Approved Labor Budget. Reduce labor drastically or resubmit an adjusted Labor Budget. JTD Labor Budget Card This is a live snapshot of the projects earned revenue through today. It is labor that has already occurred (“the past”). JTD Labor increases as people record their time in Deltek Vision. EAC Labor Budget Card Estimate at Completion. This is the remaining budget to work with and how we expect the project to perform. EAC = JTD + ETC (Actual or “the past” + Remaining or “the future”). Profit % Budget Card Profit = (Revenue – All Expenses). Measured as a percentage of NSR. Phase Bar Chart Refer to the Phase bars along the top of the Staffing Matrix to help plan hours. Any Milestones added to the Schedule will appear here. Try hovering over a phase bar to see its full name, duration, and percent complete. A Milestone hover state shows date and Notes (if added). Reviewing Rates, JTD, and ETC Expand the HOURS column to see a detailed breakdown of hours billed (JTD), hours planned (ETC) and the persons blended rate (labor cost). Project Role, Studio, and Rate are only visible when viewing Rows of Staff. Note: This information is hidden to most Staff and is made visible by Role based permissions just like Vision. Your rates are not going to be made public. Week Columns The Current Week will be outlined in black. With Previous weeks (JTD) to the left and Future weeks (ETC) to the right. JTD data is reporting from Vision and is read-only. Future hours will be editable. Cell Coloring and Icons The Staffing Module has a lot of color. It is used to draw attention to important project health metrics or to a detail you may have overlooked. Cells from the past (JTD), use conditional formatting to help communicate discrepancies between planned and actual hours. Past Cells (JTD) If a person was planned for hours, you will see the planned number in the bottom left corner. The actual hours billed in Vision will be shown in the center of the cell. In the scenario above, a person was planned to work 4 hours on a project, but did not bill time that week. Non-planned hours billed to project (not planned) In this situation, the team member was planned for zero hours (not planned) and then billed 3 hours to the project.

To manually add a new phase, click +Add and fill in the popped-up window with Phase Name and Short Code. Then set from the drop-down menus the Phase Dependency (whether it will be parent linked or not), phase type (design, construction, etc.), fee type (lump sum, hourly, etc.). Set Start or End Date, type in the date in the correspondent field and set the phase duration in weeks. You can also add the percentage of completed work, choose the phase color, and add tags. If the staffing page is set, it will return to you the amount of planned hours and cost and the actual hours and cost already spent on the project. Name Click in the search bar and select from preloaded phase names. However, phase names can be custom. Type what you want then select +Add. You can also assign an abbreviated Short Code name. If starting from a phase template all the names and Short Codes will be prefilled. Phase Dependency (Linked) When you want your phase to start at the end of a previous phase, set the phase dependency. Phase Type Phase Type is mostly used as an organizational label. Best viewed from the Table view where it appears as a data column. Phase Type options are Design, Construction, and Other. If selecting Other, you will not be able to use Phase Dependency. Phase Type ‘Other’ Phases designated as Other behave differently from Design and Construction types. They do not have phase dependency and live in their own swim lane of the Gantt chart. Fee Type Each phase can have its own Fee type and can be independent of the project budget fee type. Lock End Date This is different from Phase Dependency. Locking the end date of a phase will freeze the end date entry field. A locked end date will be identified by the Red pad lock icon when hovering over the phase. Use this feature to secure your schedule from accidental changes. Include in Staffing Most phases are labor based so this option is checked yes by default. This lets a phase appear in the Staffing module for planning. Do not Include in Staffing Use this option for creating Non-Staffed Phases. Some examples are Bidding or AHJ Review or when we are not incurring labor costs or have different fee structures. If you uncheck this box, your options will be reduced. You no longer have the option for Phase Dependency. And the phase does not appear in the Staffing module. Since these phases do not show up in Staffing, you must view them from the Table or Calendar view of the Schedule. It is recommended that these phases also be classified as Phase Type ‘Other’ for organizational purposes. Start / End Date Each Phase requires you to select either the start OR end date, and then the duration in weeks. The other date will be automatically calculated for you. Weeks are the smallest planning unit within the Project app. Note: The Project app will not allow picking the start AND end date. The entire finance industry works on firmly established weekly cycles. We aim to simplify the whole experience of planning by reducing complexity. Work Percent Complete Because labor production does not directly correlate to weeks complete, this field must be manually set by the PM. The bars on the Gantt chart graphically display phase completion. Weeks Complete / Weeks Remaining These are automatically calculated from the Duration on either side of the Current Day. Notes Only appears in the Gantt chart. Hover over a phase to see any Notes added. Financials Displays a snapshot of the ETC and JTD numbers. You must have a Budget approved for the ETC data to appear. JTD will display any time a person reports hours to Vision. Phase Color You can change the color of the phases. Tip: Building a schedule from a template will load pre-colored phases. Deltek Phase IDs* For Finance and administrative use only. This is how your Project app phases are mapped to Deltek Vision phases. Once these have been established they can only be changed by Finance.",

Design Principal will be available to assign here – the team member ultimately responsible for the design outcome of the project. CELs at our firm are “Client Engagement Leaders” – assign these here, as well. Use the + Add Member button to add the remaining members under Team. This allows you add multiples in quick succession. Click +Add Member Search by typing their name. Select the name. Click Submit *Tip* – if somebody is already on your team, they will not show up in the Add Members dropdown. If you cannot find them on your Project Team page, try getting rid of the preselected filters. Organizing your Team Placeholder Roles If you do not have a labor plan yet, use a placeholder to identify and add hours for people you believe you will need but don’t know specifically who yet. These roles (i.e., Designer II) can be replaced with real paper later, who then take on the hours you have planned for this role. These roles will appear in the PMTK Staffing tab. Click Unassigned Roles under the Actions dropdown Click Add Role in the top right corner Select your desired Studio, Rate Level, and Project Role(s) Click Submit *insert pic* Use Sub Teams to place team members into custom buckets. This is a simple label for organization purposes only. It does not correlate to a person’s title or role and can be different on each project. Sub Teams will sort alphabetically by default. For custom sorting, use the number sort parameter. Use Roles to define what a person will be doing or contributing to the project. This is also different from the person’s HR title. Roles are simple organizational labels to help to better organize and visualize your team in the Staffing module. Roles are optional. Roles do not have any impact on labor cost. Editing your Team Edit an individual Project Team member’s details by clicking on their profile photo in the list of team members. Edit Member Team Members who are classified as Managing Principal and Project Manager are automatically assigned to the Core Team during Create Project process. These will be read only for most Project app users and can only be changed by Finance admins after initial setup. All other Team Members can be assigned a Role, made Active/Inactive, and be assigned to the Core Team. Add Roles Predefined labels for organization. Roles available to assign: CEL Design Principal Interior Designer Other Project Architect Project Coordinator Project Designer Technical Coordinator Planner Sustainability Landscape Architect Urban Designer Design Team Currently Active There is no deleting a person from the Project app. If they have worked on the project and billed hours in Vision they will be locked in the project indefinitely to maintain an accurate project history. The alternative is to make a Team Member Inactive. Uncheck the box “Currently Active” in the Edit Member panel. This hides them from all modules but can be seen with filters. A person who has left the firm will automatically be made Inactive. Core Team The Core Team is comprised of the Managing Principal, Project Manager, Design Principal, and all CELs. The Core Team is meant to denote project leadership, however, additional members can be added manually in the Edit Member panel. They can be identified by the “Core Team” badge  next to their name in the Team list. Viewing your Team Active/All People toggle Toggles between listing just Active people (default) or All.  Listing by All will display people who are no longer on the project or those who have left the firm. This is to maintain an accurate project history. When viewing All, any Inactive staff will appear black and white. Their planned and actual hours remain intact so you can address your labor plan. Core Team By default, you will see All team members listed. Toggling on Core Team filter allows will show only those who have been assigned the Core Team tag. Reference the Team help document for steps on how to assign this tag. The Managing Principal, Project Manager, and Design Principal for your project will automatically be assigned to the Core Team. Group by Project Role By default, the Team will be grouped under Project Role headings. The sort order for Project Roles: Leadership (Managing Principal, Project Manager, Design Principal, and all CELs) Other Project Architect Project Coordinator Project Designer Technical Coordinator Planner Landscape Architect Urban Designer Team (have not been assigned a Role) Group by Studio You can choose to view your team by studio. This view setting will group all team by Studio and sort them by the Studio with the most staff (not alphabetically). If two studios share the same number of people, the next sorting method is number of Core Team members. Team Member count Displays the total number of staff members in your project. Team Display view By default, the Team page displays as a list view. Change the Team display view to Grid for a more presentation-ready page. Quick Glance – Staff Labor burn This bar chart is only visible in the List view. The value on the left indicates the total number of hours a person has billed to the Project from Vision. The value on the right indicates the total number of hours planned. Use these charts to identify team members who are approaching their allotment and make adjustments to fee or reduce labor. Actual (JTD)                      Planned (EAC) In this situation, this team member was only planned to work 86.5 hours, but worked and billed 144 hours. The chart does not change color or loudly indicate that they are over budget. Contact your Team There are three options available. Start a Chat in Teams Clicking the message icon will launch MS Teams and start a chat with the individual. Start a Call in Teams Clicking the phone icon will launch your web browser and ask you to select a calling app. You may see a notification in Chrome like this, choose ‘Pick an app.’ Next select MS Teams to ‘Always’ be your calling app. Start and Email in Outlook Clicking the e-mail icon will launch your Outlook and start a draft to that person.",

For example, a project may start as a marketing pursuit in Pipeline. Once it is awarded its status changes to Active and will now appear in the Project app where a Deltek number can be assigned. Project Cards These cards display only important high-level information. Featured Image, Primary Client, Project Name, Project Number, Studio & Practice, Discipline, Project type, Status, and Stage. These parameters will largely be unchanged through the course of the project and will appear read-only in many areas of the app. Once established these can only be changed by Finance. Cards display differently when changing the view mode. Project type Projects must be classified as Small, Large, or Related to another project. The cutoff between Small and Large is typically $50,000. If your project is for $50,000 or less, it is considered Small, and we do not require building a plan or submitting an approved budget. You will still need to request a project number. If you do select Small as your project type, you will be able to set up PMTK basics with schedule and contract fee, so you do not have to enter PMTK to do it. Deltek Statuses Status can be manually changed by individuals with Project Manager role permissions.  If a project pursuit was started in the Pipeline app and was awarded it becomes Active.  Once Active, the project appears in the Project app. Stages There are 7 pre-defined Stages to choose from: Pending Start, Design, Completed – Design only, Under Construction, On Hold, Completed – Unbuilt, and Completed – Built.",

On the Contracts page, you can upload any contracts you have with your Primary Client and designate which contract is the Prime Contract. When the signed final contract has been marked as Executed and is uploaded, it will then relate back to RAMP.

The righthand side of the page contains Sub Consultant information – this is directly pulled from the Consultant Team page (those consultants that are listed) and the Budget page (Direct and Reimbursable information). Each consultant has their own card with their name and Direct/Reimbursable designation.

When you expand a consultant card with the arrow button, you’ll see that this is where you upload your yearly COI – you need these from every consultant for their professional coverage specific to this project. Each card will have either a green checkmark or a red X based on the COI’s current status. Request Client/NDA Contract Review Insert photo here.",

    "content": "Storyboard Opening Storyboard, you’ll notice that the tab is organized into boards which can contain multiple media resources. Every board has a status, Active or Archived, to help manage historical data. There is one featured board per project that shows up on the Home Page of the project and the card view of the Design Management app. Storyboard does not hold the Hero Image – that is located on the Info Center tab. Once your storyboard is created, you will have the ability to upload files, edit, delete, mark as Featured, and more. Reference the count of images, files, and links within the storyboard to get a feel for what each one contains. Uploading a file allows for many different image types (JPG, PNG, Movie, 360 Images, Splat). Before you click into a storyboard, you will notice that one of the images is larger than the rest on the thumbnail – this is the first image listed when you open your storyboard. If you would like to change the image, open the storyboard, and then you can drag and drop in whatever order you would like. Once you are inside the storyboard, there are many functions you can perform. When uploading a link, you have the ability to add a thumbnail. After uploading the link, simply click on that thumbnail to open the link. After a link, file, or image is uploaded, hover over the image and click the Edit button to replace the media, change the File Name, and manually choose the Sort Order. Other operations you can perform upon hovering over the image is download, delete, view images/files in full screen mode, and even play videos directly in Hub. Design Drivers Our design drivers are carefully crafted to best serve our clients and planet: that is, every living species and the habitats they depend on. Each driver is measured by key performance indicators that assess qualitative or performance-based impact. By being more intentional in our process and purposeful in our outcomes, we’re doing our part to create a healthier world. The Living Design Framework empowers—and challenges—us to apply our values to the specific context of a given project. When we are intentional in allowing each driver to shape our work, we uncover purpose-driven design solutions and achieve something greater: Living Design. Our approach to Living Design fully embraces the mission of the International Living Future Institute, whose values we share and best practices we employ. Definitions: Poetics & Beauty – Enduring design that is aesthetically moving and imbued with meaning Conceptual Clarity – Context, design intent, and reasoned position Research & Innovation – Exploration and discovery that leads to new knowledge, pushing beyond the limitations of today to solve the most complex problems of tomorrow Technology & Tectonics – The seamless assembly of the many disparate parts of a built environment into a cohesive, elegant, and well-crafted place Community & Inclusion – Empathy and compassion nourish our culture of justice, equity and bring diverse voices to the process. Design has the power to touch lives, make memories, and bring people together around a common vision Resilience & Regeneration – Design solutions that protect, restore, and enhance the functioning of natural systems and a diversity of life – a must in a rapidly changing world with finite resources Health & Well-being – Design that promotes physical, mental, emotional, and social vitality for life in all its many forms, resulting in a thriving and diverse ecosystem Creating your Framework Click the black “+ Building” button to start your own Living Design Framework Selecting this button will have multiple buildings under the same Deltek Number Once the Design Drivers modal appears, choose your Type, your Measurement Units, and your building’s Name. You can make this this Primary option if you choose. After pressing Save, you are able to start updating your petals with your project’s design information. Use the Update button at the top right of the screen to do this. Note that each petal and field within each petal have their own set of directions. Completing all information within each petal will give you a Completion Percentage of 100%. Beneath the diagram of the petals, you will see the Type listed, along with an Edit symbol. This edit will allow you to change any of the information listed in Step 2 above. The Actions dropdown will contain a few options. Resources will take you to the Living Design Toolkit. Retired will take you to the fields that were created in the first iterations of Design Drivers that you may have filled out but are no longer requested. Click on Actions -> Active to get back to your Active Drivers. Reports is a way to see everything on one page as you fill your information out. Once everything is filled out, this should be a length document all contained on one page. Project Aspirations, released in October 2025, allows you to select which petal(s) are your design aspirations for your building. Important items to note: There are 7 petals, and each has its own place to upload files. When inputting information on petals, occasionally, depending on your answers, there are follow-up questions that will appear. Transcendent details information is on the Technology & Tectonics petal, which relates to TDC Submission. On the Resilience & Regeneration petal, Third-Party Certifications also shows up in the Marketing tab of your project. The Embodied Carbon Table on the Resilience & Regeneration petal goes to full screen, so ensure you select Save in the top right corner before exiting to go back to the Design Drivers tab. When viewing the table, click on each header to pick your input at the time. The Health & Well-Being petal has a link to the Switch List app, explained here . Design Reviews To add a Completed or Scheduled Design Review: Click the Add Review button in the top right of the Design Reviews tab Enter whether the review type is In-Studio, Peer, or Other Enter the date, past or present Add any reviewers you’d like. This can be anyone at the firm Select whether the review status is Completed or Scheduled Add any Review Notes and/or Feedback Select if this is referring the Boards or Images Important items to note: You can create this on behalf of your peers who may be talking during the design review You are able to add an entire board if you choose Other Design Info This section will only appear on your left side navigation menu if your project existed prior to PMTK. This tab now acts as a holding ground for data that no longer has a place within your project. For example, anything that was input into the old Living Design or Storyboard apps, as well as old Biennale and DEAR information, would be shown here. Awards Information TDC Submission This section will appear once your project has been added to the Transcendent Detail Competition app. Once it’s been added and you navigate to the newly shown TDC Submission tab of your project, you will find a lot of the general information has been populated from the Info Center and places like the Project Team page. You will see places to enter your Project Narrative, PDF, optional Video, and Special Conditions. Once all your pertinent information is entered, select the Submit Project button at the top right of the page.",

Search Result count 5. View modes. 6. Sorting drop-down 7. Create Project Project Card From the Project Browser you see a list of projects identified as “cards.” Each card represents a project, and each project will be associated with a single Vision number. We aim to have a one-to-one project to vision data stream. They can be created at any stage and can appear in multiple apps of Hub as they advance towards completion. For example, a project may start as a marketing pursuit in Pipeline. Once it is awarded it’s status changes to Active and will now appear in the Project app where a Vision number can be assigned. Cards display differently when changing the view mode. These cards display only important high-level information. Featured Image, Primary Client, Project Name, Project Number, Studio & Practice, Project type, Status, and Stage. These parameters will largely be unchanged through the course of the project and will appear read-only in many areas of the app. Once established these can only be changed by Finance. Duplicates can occur; to Mark as Duplicate for merging, use on the project card to update. Please leave additional notes so the development team can respond efficiently. Projects that are related can be associated manually. Project type Projects must be classified as Small, Large, or Related to another project. Statuses Status can be manually changed by individuals with Project Manager role permissions. If a project pursuit was started in the Pipeline app and was awarded it becomes Active. Once Active, the project appears in the Project app. Stages There are 17 pre-defined Stages to choose from. Modules Modules are separate pages in the Project app. Each one contains different tools and capabilities for specific tasks. Module visibility depends on the project requirements and an individual’s role permissions. Some modules are nested. For example, the PMTK contains 5 individual modules specific to the Project Management tasks. Some modules activate once a piece of information is added. For example, the AreaSync module which is nested under Performance appears only after adding a link to the AreaSync PowerBI dashboard in the Info Center. The Module Navigation panel is accessible from the left-hand side of the user interface and stays on top in all areas of the app. List of currently active modules in the Project app (Mar 23): Home (beta) Info Center Team Storyboard Design Drivers Design Reviews Other Design Info Schedule Budget Staffing Contracts RAMP AreaSync (Activates when an AreaSync link is added) 2030 Challenge Awards & Publications Settings Search bar Tip: If searching by Project Number, search using the first 6 digits. Exclude the “.000” for better results. Filter tools Tip: You can see all the projects that you or others are on from your profile in the People app. View Modes Change the way projects appear in the Browser. Fit view (default) Fit is designed for maximum card visibility. You will see the full card when a Featured Image has been uploaded to your project. If there is no image, the card will condense to just the text information. Grid view All cards are the same size and layout as a grid. List mode Lists out projects as data rows.

Review First, check to see if the project has already been created. Use the search and filter tools to help narrow down the query. If the project has already been started your next step may be Requesting a Vision number, see steps below. Create Initiate the process by clicking the Create Project button from the Project Browser page. There are 6 pieces of information you are required to provide before submitting. The only optional field here is the check box for “Related project.” 1. Project Name. Important: The Name will not be editable by most users after submitting. Editing a name must be done by a Hub admin. Please take care in naming projects regarding consistency or established naming conventions. It is recommended that you consult with your Studio’s TRT to set out or maintain consistency. 2. Related to another Project? 3. Stage will change during the project and must be manually updated by the PM. 4. Primary Studio Use this field to nominate ONE studio. You will be able to add more studios after the project has been created. 5. Primary Practice Like Studio, you are required to pick one here. Additional practices can be added later. 6. Client Name Type to search for existing entries first. This field pulls from our “Organizations” Hub app. Use existing or create new here. You will be able to add individual Contacts later. 7. Project Type Asks you to define the project size. Small ($50k or less) or Large (greater than $50k) Wizard You will land in the Info Center module immediately after creating a project. The Project Info Wizard will display that you have already provided 25% of the required info from the initial setup. Use the Wizard to guide you to 100%. You may not have all the information yet, so you can always revisit this area to complete it later. Refer to the help document on the Project Info page for more information. Project Interface Inside of a project the interface shows the same Project Info card stacked on top of the Module Navigation panel. The site is optimized for desktop, but if viewing from a phone or tablet you will see a button that allows you to expand and collapse this menu. 1. Project Info Card 2. Module Navigation panel 3. Back button – returns you to the Project Browser Project Info Card This is the same card you see on the Project browser page. Always on top, consistently visible in all modules and throughout the app experience. Module Navigation panel Use this navigation panel to bounce around to different areas of the same project. Back button The Project app icon will navigate you back to Project browser page from anywhere in the app. If you need to stay in the project but go back one page, use the back button in your web browser.",

For example a keyboard family with every key modeled in 3D is less the .5 mb when key ia nested family, but if you have 100 of these families in plan view or 3D view, the view may take very long to regenerate. Minimize geometry to what is absolutely necessary, use detal level and visibility settings to minimize unnecessary processing. Even when the family size is relatively small, the count of 3D surfaces matters most. Nesting and sharing Plan family nesting ahead. Do not nest more than 3 levels deep. Purge nested families before inserting them in the main assembly. In case you are planning to nest shared families, consider that not shared  families with the same name might exist in the project. Also consider that shared families will appear in the project browser and schedules and can be tagged even when nested. Formulas Formulas are powerful family tool. However too many formulas in the families may be slowing down Revit performance. Consider creating type catalogs in excel, where the same formulas were used in excel to pre-create certain number of types.",

The firmwide library in AVAIL has some basic doors that were created with superdoor tool, and schedules to go with them. Some offices have their own door collections in AVAIL (Boston, Atlanta, Vancouver) which are built differently than Superdoors.  They come with their own schedules and work well for these offices. If not sure, please check with your office Design Application Manager. Superdoor is a tool from CTC, the components are developed in Perkins&Will. Superdoor step-by-step: 1. Select the main door assembly We are using three groups of doors assemblies: Curtain panels (no frame,  size by instance) – magenta frame, CW in the lower left corner of the icon Wall hosted – Size by type – yellow frame, Inst-WH in the lower left corner of the icon Wall Hosted – Size by instance – green frame, WH in the lower left corner of the icon 2. Select Door Frame Only door frames compatible with your main assemblies will show up. CW doors are frameless. Frames are the windows category in Revit. 3. Select Door Panel Only door frames compatible with your main assemblies will show up. Panels are shared families if Doors category in Revit. Use pre-filtered door schedules from HIVE to filter the doors out from the schedules. you only need to schedule entire assemblies. 4. Set Parameters you can adjust the parameters later, but it is easiest to do it before the assembly is made 5. Create a Door check and adjust components and assembly names, and save the family. It is recommended NOT to load it directly to the project, but review outside and keep in mind that the panels are shared so if the panel with this name already exists, it can be overwritten on insertion of a new assembly with the same panel name Additional Resources: Superdoor microKnowledge cards",

A41-01 – STAIR – PLANS & SECTIONS A41-50 – STAIR DETAILS A41-51 – STAIR DETAILS ALL OTHER DETAILS can be loaded as an entire sheet or a’la carte from HIVE (2018 and later) ​​A50-01 – ARCHITECTURAL CABINETS AND COUNTERTOPS A51-01 – CEILING DETAILS ​A61-01 – INTERIOR PARTITION TYPE CHARTS A61-02 – INTERIOR PARTITION TYPE CHARTS A61-50 – INTERIOR PARTITION DETAILS A62-50 – INTERIOR DOOR AND FRAME DETAILS A62-51 – INTERIOR DOOR AND FRAME DETAILS A62-52 – INTERIOR DOOR AND FRAME DETAILS A63-01 – INTERIOR WINDOW DETAILS G02-01 – FIRE RESISTANCE DETAILS AND DIAGRAMS G02-02 – FIRE RESISTANCE DETAILS AND DIAGRAMS It is recommended to load entire sheets of standard details and delete the ones you do not need for your project. They come with neutral titleblock, after you are done reviewing them, swap the titleblock to the project specific one. Office Specific Details Some offices have published  in HIVE their own detail collections. they are intended to use only in the office which had published them. If you want to find appropriate details for your project. search in YOUR office library and a firmwide collection first if not found, search other offices collection – and check with your technical authority whether it needs to be modified for your project.",

Here is an outline of the foundational framework common to all Perkins&Will model authoring: Common Shared parameters Common User subcategories Line weights, styles, and patterns Fill patterns Text styles, dimension styles Arrows, tags, annotations All Perkins&Will templates are forged from the centrally managed “Baseline” template. Templates The Baseline template is rebuilt from scratch every three years, so as to be fully compatible with the latest requirements released by Autodesk. On the off-years, the template is evaluated, new features/content added or removed, and then upgraded to the latest version. All studio templates begin with the Baseline template, each studio may add to their template based on unique circumstances. When creating a new Revit project, use the Project Create Tool and select the template for your studio and practice. See How it Works",

The ecosystem is made up of various templates, workflows and content. To aid in organizing the vast number of moving parts in this ecosystem, both an underlying framework from which all Revit projects begin, and a content management system [CMS] are in place at Perkins&Will. This guide will review each of these components and point you to additional information so you can leverage them in your projects. Additional chapters are included for those who create, plan and maintain content. These chapters focus on content creation standards, quality checks, template maintenance, tools for re-using content assets as well as managing our CMS.",

    "content": "Rhino files are primarily organized by Layers. Those of you familiar with AutoCAD should recognize the Rhino system. Layers can have sub-Layers and object properties, like lineweight, color, material… and many more, can be associated with the Layer. This system is incredibly flexible and allows a Team to  customize it to suit their needs. The template below provides a starting point for design studies, collaboration, model analysis and interoperability with Revit. Additional workflows may require additional layers be added. Coordinate changes to the Rhino layering system with the entire Team. Include Rhino layering starting point in BIM XP? DESIGN Layer Most of your work will take place in this folder. Be your cool designer self. Make sub-layers. ANALYSIS Layer The ANALYSIS Layer contains sub-Layers that feed into the various Analysis and computational design workflows that are executed through Rhino, which are often very picky about the type of geometry they work with. Occasionally a program will need a root-level layer, not under ANALYSIS, communicate this to your team. CONVEYOR Layer Being able to import data-rich geometry from Rhino into Revit eliminates the remodeling that was previously necessary when switching between software platforms. The Semantic and Conveyor plugins translate Rhino geometry and parameters into native Revit elements that show up in drawings and schedules. This is accomplished by having particular Rhino Layers associated with Revit Families. Import the Rhino File, Create the Revit Element. Refer to the Conveyor documentation for detailed information on the Layer structure and the types of Revit Elements Conveyor can produce.",
